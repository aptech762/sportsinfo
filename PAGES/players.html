                    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (born 5 February 1985), better known as Cristiano Ronaldo, is
                        a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward. He plays for the Premier League
                        club Manchester United and is the captain of the Portuguese national team. He is considered to
                        be one of the greatest footballers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest ever.</p>
                    <p>Ronaldo began his professional career with Sporting CP at age 17 in 2002, and signed for
                        Manchester United a year later. He won the FA Cup in his first season, and then won three
                        back-to-back Premier League titles: in 2006-07, 2007-08, and 2008-09. In 2007-08, Ronaldo helped
                        United win the UEFA Champions League. In 2008-09, he won his first FIFA Club World Cup in
                        December 2008, and he also won his first Ballon d'Or. At one point Ronaldo was the most
                        expensive professional footballer of all time, after moving from Manchester United to Real
                        Madrid for approximately £80 m in July 2009.</p>
                    <p>He won his first trophy with Real Madrid in 2011, the 2010-11 Copa del Rey. In the next season,
                        he won his first La Liga title with the club, the 2011-12 La Liga. In the 2012-13 season he won
                        the Supercopa de España. In the next season, the 2013-14 season, he won his second Ballon d'Or.
                        Then he won the Copa del Rey, and he also won his second Champions League with a record 17
                        goals. The following year, Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or again, along with his second FIFA Club
                        World Cup in December 2014. In 2016, Ronaldo won his third Champions League, and scored the
                        winning penalty in the final against Atlético Madrid. He won his fourth Ballon d'or the next
                        season, his second La Liga title for the first time in five years, another Champions League, and
                        his second Club World Cup. Ronaldo's last season with Real Madrid was the 2017-18 season, where
                        he won his fifth Ballon d'Or in 2017, and also won his fifth Champions League and scored two
                        goals in the final against Juventus. With his third consecutive Champions League, he became the
                        first player to win the UEFA Champions League five times.[18] He would later go on to transfer
                        to Juventus in July 2018. Ronaldo left the club by holding the record for being the top goal
                        scorer in Real Madrid's history, and remaining as the only player in La Liga's history to score
                        30 or more goals in six consecutive seasons.</p>
                    <p>Ronaldo began his career with Portugal at age 18. He scored his first goal at UEFA Euro 2004 and
                        helped Portugal reach the final, although they lost to Greece 1-0. The first World Cup he played
                        at was the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He scored a goal and helped Portugal earn fourth place. Two
                        years later, he became Portugal's full captain. Since then, he has appeared at three Euro's:
                        2008, 2012, and 2016, and two World Cups: 2014 and 2018. He helped Portugal win their first
                        major international trophy at Euro 2016, and their second three years later with the UEFA
                        Nations League.</p>
                    <p>He currently Plays for Manchester United and his shirt number is 7. He is now considered the
                        greatest of all time with the most goals of 800+ in his all time of carrer.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">On 12 August 2003, Ronaldo joined Manchester United from Sporting CP for a
                            fee of £12.24 million.[24] He was Manchester United's first Portuguese player. He wanted the
                            number 28, the number he wore at Sporting, but was eventually given the number 7. This
                            number had been worn by George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham before him. He played
                            his first game for the club on 16 August 2003 in a 4-0 win against Bolton Wanderers.[25]
                            Many people were impressed with his debut, including legendary United player George
                            Best.[26] Ronaldo's first goal with Manchester United was a free kick. He scored it in a 3-0
                            win against Portsmouth on 1 November 2003.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Ronaldo won his first trophy in England, the 2003-04 FA Cup, in May 2004, when
                            Manchester United beat Millwall 3-0. Ronaldo scored the first goal of the match.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Ronaldo scored his first UEFA Champions League goals in a 7-1 victory against
                            A.S. Roma in April 2007. He scored two goals that day in what was his 30th Champions League
                            match.[29] He played the FA Cup Final that year, but United lost 1-0 to Chelsea.[30] Even
                            though he lost the FA Cup final, he didn't end the season without a title, because he won
                            his first Premier League title.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">n the 2007-08 season, Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for Manchester
                            United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008.[32] In the 2008 Champions
                            League final against Chelsea, he scored a header as the match ended 1-1 after extra time.
                            Although he missed his penalty, Manchester United won the shootout 6-5 and Ronaldo won his
                            first UEFA Champions League.[33] On 15 November 2008, Ronaldo scored his 100th goal for
                            United in a 5-0 win against Stoke City. He also scored two free-kicks: the first one was his
                            100th goal.[34] He scored a total of 42 goals and won the European Golden Boot, an award
                            given to the top scorer of every European national league.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">He won the first FIFA Puskas Award in 2009. The Puskas Award is given to whoever
                            scores the best goal of that year. The goal was a 40-yard strike into the top-left corner
                            against FC Porto on 15 April 2009 in the Champions League quarter finals. That goal was the
                            only goal of the game. It was also an important goal because it sent United to the
                            semi-finals.[35] In the semi-final against Arsenal, Ronaldo scored two goals. One of them
                            was a free kick from 40 yards out. His goals helped Man United qualify to the final, where
                            they lost to Barcelona 2-0.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Ronaldo joined Real Madrid on 1 July 2009 for a fee of €94 million. That
                            was a world record transfer fee at the time. He also signed a six-year contract with the
                            club.[36] At his presentation as a Real Madrid player, 80,000 people greeted him at the
                            Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. This is the world record, breaking the 25-year record of 75,000
                            people at Diego Maradona's presentation for Napoli.[37] He wore the number 9 in his first
                            season because number 7 was taken by Raúl González. Ronaldo had to wait until Raul left the
                            club in the summer of 2010 to wear number 7.[38] He made his debut (first appearance) on 29
                            August 2009, in a La Liga game against Deportivo de La Coruña. He scored a goal and Real
                            Madrid won 3-2. On 23 October 2010, Ronaldo scored 4 goals in a match for the first time in
                            his career during a 6-1 win against Racing de Santander.[39] Ronaldo scored a header in
                            extra time in the 2011 Copa del Rey final against rivals Barcelona. His goal was the match
                            winner, so that was Ronaldo's first trophy in Spain.[40] At the end of the 2010-11 season,
                            he became the first player to score 40 goals in La Liga.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 2 November 2011, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2-0 Champions League group
                            stage win against Olympique Lyon. The second goal was his 100th goal for Real Madrid. He
                            achieved this in just 105 matches.[42][43] He scored his 100th La Liga goal for his club in
                            just 92 appearances in a 5-1 win against Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Ronaldo began the 2012-13 season by winning the 2012 Supercopa de España. He
                            scored in both legs, as Real Madrid won against Barca.[45] In October 2012, he scored his
                            first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4-1 win against Ajax.[46] On 6 January 2013,
                            Ronaldo captained his club for the first time.[47] In May 2013, he scored his 200th goal for
                            Real Madrid in a 6-2 win against Málaga.[48] He finished as the Champions League top scorer
                            that season. Ronaldo also won his second Ballon d'Or in 2013.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In the 2013-14 season, Ronaldo broke the record for most goals in one Champions
                            League season by scoring his 17th goal with a penalty in extra time in the final against
                            Atlético Madrid that Real Madrid won 4–1.[50] The previous record was 14 goals, set by Messi
                            in the 2011-12 season.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In the 2014-15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal record by scoring 61 goals in
                            all competitions. This achievement helped him win his second Ballon d'Or.[51] He scored five
                            goals in one match for the first time in his career in a 9-1 win vs. Granada on 5 April
                            2015.[52] He became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer when he scored 5 goals against RCD
                            Espanyol in a 6-0 away win on 12 September 2015. This brought his total goal tally to 230
                            goals in 203 games. The previous record holder was Raul.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 18 April 2017, he became the first player to reach 100 goals in the UEFA
                            Champions League, after he scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 extra-time win against Bayern
                            Munich.[55] On 18 March 2018, Ronaldo reached his 50th career hat-trick in a 6-3 win against
                            Girona.[56] Ronaldo scored an amazing bicycle-kick in a UEFA Champions League match against
                            Juventus on 3 April 2018. He got a standing ovation, or round of applause, from the Juventus
                            fans after scoring that goal.[57] Real Madrid went on to play the final against Liverpool
                            F.C.. Real Madrid became champions, so that was Ronaldo's 5th Champions League.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">On 10 July 2018, He joined Juventus of Italy and signed a 4 year contract
                            worth 112 Million Euros.[59][60] The transfer was the highest paid for a player over 30
                            years old.[61] People called it "the deal of the century".</p>
                        <p class="px-2">He scored his first goals for the club on 16 September against US Sassuolo.
                            Juventus won 2-1 at home. Three days later, on 19 September, he was controversially sent off
                            against Valencia C.F. for "violent behavior".[63] He was crying as he received the red card
                            and said he "did nothing".[64] Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club, the 2018
                            Supercoppa Italiana, in January 2019. In the match, he scored the only goal from a header
                            against AC Milan.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Ronaldo began his international career with the Portugal under-15's in
                            2001. In 2002, he played the U-17 Euro with Portugal's U-17. In June 2003, Ronaldo won the
                            Toulon Tournament with the Portugal U-20. He played with the U21's in 2003 as well during
                            the 2004 U-21 Euro qualification stages. He also played with the Portugal under-23 team at
                            the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he scored one goal against Morocco.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">He kept progressing through the youth national teams until he played his first
                            senior game for Portugal when he was 18 on 20 August 2003 against Kazakhstan. He scored his
                            first goal for Portugal in a game against Greece at the UEFA Euro 2004.

                            Ronaldo was selected to play at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was also his first World Cup.
                            During the tournament, he scored a goal against Iran. That goal was also his first World Cup
                            goal. In the match against England, Ronaldo's teammate at Manchester United, Wayne Rooney,
                            was sent off. Ronaldo went up to the referee and appeared to ask the ref to give a red card
                            to Rooney. Rooney pushed Ronaldo as he was talking to the ref. After Rooney left the pitch,
                            Ronaldo was caught on camera winking at the Portugal bench.[67] Even though the referee said
                            Rooney would've gotten the red card if Ronaldo complained or not, these actions caused a lot
                            of fans to hate Ronaldo because they believed he influenced the referee's decision.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Ronaldo became captain of Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against
                            Brazil on 6 February 2007. At Euro 2008, he scored one goal against Czech Republic. Portugal
                            were eliminated in the quarter-finals by barely losing to Germany 3-2.[69] In the 2010 World
                            Cup, Ronaldo only scored one goal in a 7-0 win against North Korea, but was the man of the
                            match in all of Portugal's 3 group stage games.Portugal were eliminated in the round of 16
                            by Spain 1-0, and Spain went on to win the World Cup.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">His first international hat-trick came in a 4-2 win against Northern Ireland on
                            6 September 2013. In that match, he scored 3 goals in 15 minutes.[74] He became Portugal's
                            all time top scorer when he scored twice against Cameroon in March 2014, with Portugal
                            winning 5-1.[75] At the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a goal against Ghana, and assisted a
                            last minute equalizer in a 2-2 draw against the United States. In a 3-3 draw against Hungary
                            in Euro 2016, Ronaldo scored a back heel goal. This goal made him the first player to score
                            in four Euros.[76] Although he had to leave the game early because he got injured in the
                            UEFA Euro 2016 Final, Portugal still won 1-0 in extra time because of a goal from Eder.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In the 2018 World Cup held in Russia, Ronaldo scored 4 goals. In Portugal's
                            first group game, he scored a hat trick against Spain in a 3-3 draw. After that he scored
                            the winning goal against Morocco. In the last group game, he missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw
                            against Iran. Portugal qualified to the knockout stages by finishing second in the group.
                            They were eliminated by Uruguay 2-1. Ronaldo became one of only four players to score at 4
                            World Cups. He has played at 4 of them: 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In June 2019, Ronaldo won the UEFA Nations League with Portugal to give him his
                            second international title. In the final, Portugal beat The Netherlands 1-0.</p>

                    <p>Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi Cuccittini (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi]) (born 24
                        June 1987) is an Argentine footballer. He plays for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the
                        Argentina national team as a forward.</p>
                    <p>Many experts and critics consider Messi as one of the greatest football players of all time. Some
                        even say he is the greatest player ever. Messi has seven Ballon d'Or awards, the most of any
                        player, and two more than Cristiano Ronaldo. His playing style and skills are very similar to
                        the Argentine legend Diego Maradona because of their short height. There is much competition
                        between him and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo because of their similar skill levels.

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Messi began football at a young age and his potential was quickly seen by
                            Barcelona. He left Newell's Old Boys' youth team in September 2000 and moved with his family
                            to Europe in February 2001. He officially signed with Barcelona in December 2000 on a
                            napkin. They moved to Spain because Barcelona offered their help to treat his growth hormone
                            deficiency, and Newell's didn't offer any help.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Messi played his first professional match at 16 years old on 16 November 2003
                            against Porto. He played the 2003-04 season with the Barcelona B team. He was promoted to
                            the A team for the 2004-05 season, and made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against
                            Espanyol as a substitute. He made his league debut at age 17, and became the youngest player
                            to play for Barcelona's first team in an official competition. He scored his first
                            professional goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete Balompie from a sublime assist by
                            Ronaldinho. The goal made him the youngest-ever scorer for the club at that time. Barcelona
                            won the La Liga that season for the first time in 6 years, and won the league for a second
                            time in a row along with the Spanish Super Cup and UEFA Champions League in 2006.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">His first breakthrough season was in the 2006–07 season; he became a first team
                            regular by scoring his first hat-trick of his career in El Clásico. On 18 April 2007, he
                            scored a goal almost exactly identical to Maradona's "Goal of the Century" against England
                            in the 1986 World Cup, where Maradona got the ball behind the halfway line on the right side
                            and beat 4 defenders and the goalie to score. Messi's goal was similar to this; he received
                            a pass from Xavi on the right side behind half-field, and then nut-megged an opponent and 4
                            others including the goalie before finishing off with his right foot inside the penalty
                            box.[7] In 2019, Barcelona fans voted it as the best goal in the club's history, receiving
                            45% of votes.[8] After Ronaldinho left the club at the end of the 2007-08 season, Messi was
                            handed the number 10 shirt. The 2008-09 season was arguably one of the most successful
                            seasons in his stellar career. In this season, Messi scored 38 goals in all competitions,
                            including one in the Champions League final against Manchester United that Barcelona won 2–0
                            as part of their treble. In the following 2009–10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all
                            competitions. That levelled to Ronaldo Nazario's record total for Barcelona. Messi also won
                            his first Ballon d'Or in December 2009, and also won his second a year later. He scored
                            again in the 2011 Champions League final against their same opponent two years earlier,
                            Manchester United. Barcelona won 3-1. Messi won his third Ballon d'Or in a row that year.

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">After a situation involving FC Barcelona and their overwhelming wage bill,
                            Messi made the most shocking transfer to the French football club Paris-Saint Germain.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">La Liga rules made it impossible for Barca, amid their financial problems, to
                            renew their star player’s contract and as such Messi was forced to move to PSG on a Bosman
                            transfer.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Messi won Ligue 1 with PSG in his first year with the club, but his debut season
                            in France fell short of the huge expectations that surrounded his change of team.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Messi was allowed to play for both Spain and Argentina since he had
                            dual-nationality, but he decided to play for his home country, Argentina. He led the team to
                            the final game of the 2005 U-20 World Cup by scoring important goals in the knockout stages.
                            Messi scored two goals in the final against Nigeria, and Argentina won 2–1. In addition to
                            receiving a winner's medal, Messi was also awarded the Golden Shoe for most goals scored
                            (6), and Golden Ball for best player.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Messi played his first game with the senior team on 17 August 2005 against
                            Hungary. He came on as a substitute. However, he was shown a red card 45 seconds into the
                            game for hitting an opponent in the face on accident while Messi was trying to pull the
                            opponent off from his shirt. Messi scored his first goal for Argentina in a friendly match
                            against Croatia on 1 March 2006. Argentina lost the game 3-2.[9] He was selected for the
                            2006 World Cup by coach José Pekerman. In Argentina's second game against Serbia, he became
                            their youngest player to play at a World Cup. He also assisted a goal scored the last one in
                            the 6–0 victory. That goal made him the youngest goalscorer in the 2006 World Cup.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Messi won the 2008 Olympics with Argentina as well, as he assisted Ángel Di
                            Maria's goal in the final against Nigeria in Beijing. Messi was made captain of the national
                            team in 2011. He scored his first hat-trick with the country in his 68th appearance during a
                            3-1 victory against Switzerland in February 2012.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 21 June 2016, he broke the top scoring record for Argentina by scoring his
                            55th goal with a gem of a free-kick against the United States in the Copa América
                            Centenario. It was regarded as the best free-kick scored by Messi during his career. The
                            record was previously held by Gabriel Batistuta with 54 goals.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties 4-2 in the Copa
                            América Centenario final after a 0–0 tie. Messi missed his penalty in the penalty shootout.
                            This was Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and
                            his fourth overall. A day after the match, Messi announced his retirement from international
                            football. In an emotional interview after the game, he said he was very sad that he missed
                            the penalty and also sad that he wasn't able to win any trophies in four finals.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">He came out of retirement in October 2016 for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers.

                            After a slow start to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, he helped Argentina qualify to the next round
                            of the competition by scoring the first goal in the 2-1 win over Nigeria.

                            Jumping to 2021 with the new coach, Lionel Scaloni, Argentina won the Copa America in June.
                            With Dimaria's goal in the 11th minute, they beat Brazil 1-0 in their home ground. Which was
                            one of the main reasons for Messi winning the Ballon do'r for the record 7th time and
                            counting.

                            In the mid-year 2022 Messi and the amazing Argentina team along with Lionel Scaloni beat
                            Italy 3-0 and won the Finalissma trophy.</p>

                    <p>Diego Armando Maradona (30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional
                        footballer and manager. He was nicknamed El Diez, Pelusa, El Diego and El Pibe de Oro (The
                        Golden Boy). He is widely regarded as one of the best footballers ever because of his skill
                        moves and ability to score goals, so this is why many people compare him to Brazilian legend
                        Pelé.[7] They were both winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th century award.</p>
                    <p>Maradona made 91 appearances and scored 34 goals with Argentina. He played at four world cups.
                        His greatest and most important achievement was winning the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Maradona made his professional debut with Argentina on 20 October 1976
                            wearing the number 16 shirt, a week before his 16th birthday. He scored his first goal in
                            November 1976 two weeks after turning 16. In 1981, he transferred to Boca Juniors, and won
                            the league title with them that same year. His performances at the 1982 FIFA World Cup
                            attracted the interest of FC Barcelona, and they signed him shortly after the tournament.
                        </p>
                        <p class="px-2">In the 1984 Copa Del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao, Maradona was involved in
                            a fight with several other Bilbao players. During the game, Bilbao player Andoni Goikoetxea
                            made a rough tackle on Maradona, and Bilbao fans insulted Maradona and his family. This made
                            him very angry. Barca lost 1-0, and when he was insulted by Miguel Sola at the end of the
                            match, Maradona lost control and became furious. He headbutted Sola, kneed Bilbao's goalie
                            in the head, elbowed another one in the face, and kicked and punched other players as
                            well.[8] This ended up being his last game with the Catalan club.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Maradona signed for Napoli in the summer of 1984 for around €8 million. At his
                            presentation, he was greeted by 75,000 fans at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples. He led the
                            club to its first Serie A title in 1987. That same year, he won the Coppa Italia. For the
                            1987-88 season, Maradona was top scorer of the league, with 15 goals. Napoli also finished
                            second in the league to A.C. Milan. In the 1989 UEFA Cup Final against VfB Stuttgart,
                            Maradona played an important role in Napoli's victory. He scored and assisted Careca's goal
                            in the 2-1 victory during the first leg. In the second leg, he assisted Ciro Ferrara's goal
                            in a 3-3 draw (5-4 on aggregate). The following year, Napoli won the Supercoppa Italiana
                            with a 5-1 demolishing of Juventus.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In March 1991, Maradona failed a drug test for cocaine. He was given a 15-month
                            ban and a fine, so he missed the rest of the 1990-91 season and the entire 1991-92 season.
                            After being allowed to return to football in June 1992, he didn't want to return to Napoli,
                            and he asked for a transfer. He eventually signed for Spanish club Sevilla. He stayed there
                            for one year. He moved back to the Argentine League with Newell's Old Boys in 1993, and
                            stayed there for one season. Maradona ended his career by making a return to Boca Juniors in
                            1995. He stayed there for two years until retiring on 25 October 1997. He played his last
                            match against Boca's rival River Plate, and Boca won 2-1.</p>

                            February 1977 against Hungary, as a 16 year old.

                            Maradona is most famously known for his performance against England in the 1986 World Cup
                            quarter final, where he scored two legendary goals. The first one was controversially scored
                            with his hand. It started with a poor clearance from an English defender that sent the ball
                            into the penalty box. As goalkeeper Peter Shilton came off his line to challenge the ball,
                            Maradona jumped and punched it in past Shilton, while also adding a movement as if he hit
                            the ball with his head that fooled the referees. He later called it the "Hand of God", and
                            said that he used his hand because he knew he was not going to reach the ball. The second
                            one was voted the best goal scored in World Cup history in 2002 and many people call it the
                            "Goal of the Century", where he received the ball behind the half-field line and dribbled
                            five England players before juking out goalkeeper Shilton and passing the ball with his left
                            foot into the open net from 6 yards out. The match ended 2-1 in favor of Argentina.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Argentina won the World Cup after defeating West Germany in the final, and
                            Maradona was named as the tournament's best player. The British named him "athlete of the
                            decade.</p>

                    <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar AO BR (born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer
                        who captained the Indian national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the
                        history of cricket.[4]He is the all time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test Format with
                        more than 18000 runs and 15000 runs respectively in total.[5] He also holds the record for
                        receiving most Man-of-the-match awards in International Cricket with all forms combined.[6] He
                        is sometimes referred to as "The God of Cricket" in India. A film with that name was released in
                        2021.</p>
                    <p>Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989
                        against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically
                        and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career,
                        Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the
                        second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[8] Later in his career, Tendulkar
                        was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup
                        appearances for India.[9] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003
                        edition of the tournament.</p>
                    <p>Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel
                        Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan
                        awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.[10][11] A few
                        hours after the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced
                        the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. As of 2021, he is
                        the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] In
                        2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2010, Time magazine included Tendulkar in its annual Time 100 list as one of the most
                        influential people in the world. endulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for
                        cricketer of the year at the 2010 ICC Awards. Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012, he
                        retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match. Tendulkar
                        played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs. n 2013, Tendulkar was
                        included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in 2013 to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden
                        Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist batsman of the post–World War II era, along
                        with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team. In 2019 he was inducted into the ICC Cricket
                        Hall of Fame.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">On 14 November 1987, the 14-year-old Tendulkar was selected to represent
                            Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the
                            1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches,
                            though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[41] He narrowly missed out on playing
                            alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987
                            Cricket World Cup.[41] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days,
                            Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede stadium and scored 100 not
                            out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class
                            cricket.[54] He was selected to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip
                            Vengsarkar after watching him easily playing India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil
                            Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium's Cricket practice nets,[26] where the Indian team had come to
                            play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his
                            first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest
                            run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth-highest run-scorer
                            overall.[56] In 1995–96 Irani trophy he captained Mumbai against Rest of India team.[57] He
                            also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the
                            1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[58] Sachin was picked for a young Indian team
                            to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in 1988 and 1989.[59] In the
                            famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which Haryana defeated Bombay by two runs after
                            leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 balls was a key to giving Bombay a
                            chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In the final of 1995 Ranji trophy, Tendulkar scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab at
                            Wankhede playing as a captain. Against Haydrabad 53, 128 in 2000, 105, 43 against Bengal in
                            2007 are the innings he played for Mumbai in the final of Ranji trophy at Wankhede stadium.
                        </p>
                        <p class="px-2">His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the
                            visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998. He is the only player to score a
                            century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and
                            Duleep Trophies). Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the
                            semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his
                            career. Tendulkar was part of 5 Ranji trophy finals in which Mumbai won 4.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to
                            represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even
                            from outside Yorkshire. Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian
                            fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and
                            scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the
                            Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[67] after one first class season.[68] The Indian
                            selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West
                            Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him
                            to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career.
                            Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and
                            205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that
                            match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the
                            Pakistani pace attack.[69] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose
                            by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even
                            as he gushed blood from it.[70] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel
                            with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which
                            he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[71] This was later called
                            "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari
                            Srikkanth.[72] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was
                            dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played. Thus
                            Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16
                            years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16
                            years and 238 days.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at
                            an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test. He was dismissed
                            without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other. On
                            his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest
                            cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford
                            in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in
                            the match. Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and
                            also wrote:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;" class="px-5">"He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener,
                            Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of
                            strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from
                            the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty
                            short deliveries from the English pacemen."</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92
                            tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in
                            the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia.
                            He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace
                            attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan
                            Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Deshabandu Muttiah Muralitharan is a Sri Lankan cricket coach, former professional cricketer,
                        businessman and a member of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Averaging over six wickets per Test
                        match, Muralitharan is widely regarded as the most successful and one of the greatest bowlers in
                        the history of the sport. He is the only bowler to take 800 Test wickets and more than 530 One
                        Day International (ODI) wickets. As of 2022, he has taken more wickets in international cricket
                        than any other bowler.</p>
                    <p>Muralitharan's international career was beset by controversy over his bowling action. Due to an
                        unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery, his bowling action was
                        called into question on a number of occasions by umpires and sections of the cricket
                        community.[5] After biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions, Muralitharan's
                        action was cleared by the International Cricket Council, first in 1996 and again in 1999.</p>
                    <p>Muralitharan held the number one spot in the International Cricket Council's player rankings for
                        Test bowlers for a record period of 1,711 days spanning 214 Test matches.[7] He became the
                        highest wicket-taker in Test cricket when he overtook the previous record-holder Shane Warne on
                        3 December 2007. Muralitharan had previously held the record when he surpassed Courtney Walsh's
                        519 wickets in 2004, but he suffered a shoulder injury later that year and was overtaken by
                        Warne. Muralitharan took the wicket of Gautam Gambhir on 5 February 2009 in Colombo to surpass
                        Wasim Akram's ODI record of 502 wickets.[11] He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering
                        his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match.</p>
                    <p>Muralitharan was rated the greatest Test match bowler by Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack in 2002,
                        and in 2017 was the first Sri Lankan cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
                        He won the Ada Derana Sri Lankan of the Year award in 2017.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">In domestic cricket, Muralitharan played for two first-class Sri Lankan
                            sides, Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club in the Premier Trophy and Central Province in
                            the Provincial Championship. His record is exceptional – 234 wickets at 14.51 runs in 46
                            matches.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">He also played county cricket in England, mainly for Lancashire (1999, 2001,
                            2005 and 2007), appearing in twenty-eight first-class games for the club. He played five
                            first class games for Kent during the 2003 season. His bowling record in English domestic
                            cricket is also exceptional – 236 wickets at 15.62 runs in 33 matches. Despite his efforts,
                            he was never on a title-winning first-class domestic team in either the Premier Trophy or
                            the County Championship. He was unusual amongst his contemporaries in that he played in more
                            Test matches than other first-class games (116 Tests and 99 other first-class matches as of
                            30 November 2007). Muralitharan was signed by Gloucestershire in 2011 to play in T20
                            matches. He renewed his T20 contract with Gloucestershire in 2012, but did not stay on for
                            the 2013 season.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Muralitharan was contracted to represent Bengal in the 2008–09 Ranji Trophy
                            tournament. He was expected to play about four matches in the tournament's second division –
                            the Plate League.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In February 2008, Muralitharan was slated to play Twenty20 cricket for the
                            Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was bought for $600,000 by India
                            Cements, the Chennai franchisee of the IPL, through a bidding process.[31] The Chennai Super
                            Kings were the runners-up in the inaugural edition of the IPL, losing to the Rajasthan
                            Royals in the final. Muralitharan captured 11 wickets in 15 games, at an economy rate of
                            6.96 an over. In 2010, in the third season of IPL, Muralitharan was part of the Chennai
                            Super Kings side that won the IPL championship. Muralitharan also remained the side's
                            leading wicket-taker after all the three tournaments.At the 2011 IPL Player Auction
                            Muralitharan was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala for US$1.1 million.In the 2012 season
                            Muralitharan moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore, where he took 14 wickets in 9 games and
                            had an average economy rate of 6.38. He played for Royal Challengers Bangalore from 2012 to
                            2014. He decided to retire from the IPL in 2014. In 2015, Muralitharan was appointed as the
                            bowling coach and mentor of the IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Muttiah Muralitharan signed for the Melbourne Renegades to play Twenty20 cricket
                            in the Big Bash League in 2012. He stated, "I wanted to play one season in Australia and the
                            opportunity from the Melbourne Renegades was there so I took it with both hands."</p>

                    <div class="para-container pt-2">
                        <img src="../IMAGES/muralitest.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">On 28 August 1992 at the age of 20, Muralitharan made his debut against
                            Australia at the Khettarama Stadium and claimed 3 for 141. Craig McDermott was his first
                            Test wicket. His freakish action and his angular run-up showed that this was no
                            run-of-the-mill spinner. During his first Test, there was one dismissal which convinced many
                            of Muralitharan's special powers. Tom Moody's leg-stump was dislodged when he shouldered
                            arms to a delivery that pitched at least two feet outside the off-stump.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">The youthful Muralitharan went from strength to strength, playing a major part
                            in Sri Lanka's back-to-back Test victories against England and New Zealand in 1992–93. It
                            was at this point in his career that he struck a close bond with his leader, mentor and one
                            time business partner, the authoritative captain Arjuna Ranatunga. This relationship formed
                            the bedrock of his success and meant that there were few doubts about his status as the
                            team's sole wicket-taker. Ranatunga was thoroughly convinced that Muralitharan's precocious
                            talent would signal a new era in Sri Lanka's short Test history.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Muralitharan continued to baffle batsman outside the shores of Sri Lanka,
                            irrespective of the team's performance. In Sri Lanka's humiliating drubbing at the hands of
                            India in 1993–94, where all three Tests were innings defeats, Muralitharan was the sole
                            success, with 12 wickets in the rubber. His perseverance in the face of some astronomical
                            scores by the fearsome quartet of Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Navjot Sidhu and
                            Vinod Kambli was in sharp contrast to the submission with which his teammates played the
                            series.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Prior to the eventful Boxing Day Test of 1995, Muralitharan had captured 80
                            wickets in 22 Tests at an unflattering average of 32.74. Even at that point in his career he
                            was the leading wicket taker for Sri Lanka having gone past Rumesh Ratnayake's aggregate of
                            73 wickets.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In January 1998, Muralitharan took his first ten-wicket haul against Zimbabwe in
                            the first test at Kandy. Sri Lanka won by eight wickets and Muralitharan had figures of 12
                            for 117.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In August that same year Muralitharan produces his career-best test match
                            figures of 16 for 220, in the one-off test against England. In England's second innings
                            Muralitharan bowled a marathon 54.2 overs to pick up 9 for 65 runs,[45] the other wicket
                            being a run out. Ben Hollioake becomes his 200th test wicket. Sri Lanka won by ten wickets,
                            their first Test victory in England. After breaking the world record for the most test
                            wickets in 2007, Muralitharan commented that his 1998 performance at the Oval against
                            England, was his career highlight. He stated "Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and
                            I didn't look back from there."</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 4 January 2002 in Kandy Muralitharan might have finished with the best-ever
                            figures for a single innings, but after he had claimed nine wickets against Zimbabwe Russel
                            Arnold dropped a catch at short leg.[37] He missed out on the tenth when Chaminda Vaas
                            dismissed Henry Olonga caught behind amid stifled appeals. Muralitharan follows up his 9 for
                            51 in the first innings with 4 for 64 in the second, equalling Richard Hadlee's record of 10
                            ten-wicket match hauls, but needing 15 fewer Tests to do so.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 16 March 2004 Muralitharan became the fastest and the youngest bowler to
                            reach 500 wickets during the second test between Sri Lanka and Australia played in Kandy. In
                            his 87th test, he bowled Kasprowicz to claim his 500th victim just four days after Warne
                            reached the landmark on the fifth day of the First Test between the two teams at Galle.
                            Warne took 108 tests to reach 500. Muralitharan took 4–48 on the first day of the second
                            Test as Australia were skittled for 120 in the first innings.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In July 2007, Muralitharan achieved a career peak Test Bowling Rating of 920,
                            based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin
                            bowler in Test cricket. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever Test
                            bowling ratings.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Muralitharan has the unique distinction of getting 10 or more wickets in a match
                            against all other nine Test playing nations as well as capturing over 50 wickets against
                            each of them. He also obtained 7 or more wickets in an innings against five nations, namely
                            England, India, South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe (refer to table above). Muttiah
                            Muralitharan also took at least five five-fors against all the other nine Test sides.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Another comparison of Muralitharan's bowling record against other successful
                            international bowlers is their career record away from home. Muralitharan received criticism
                            that he enjoyed great success on home soil, taking wickets on pitches that are more
                            spin-friendly than other international pitches A quick analysis of his Test record of
                            matches played outside Sri Lanka shows that from 52 matches he took 278 wickets at an
                            average of 26.24 runs per wicket, with a strike rate of 60.1 balls per wicket.[66]
                            Similarly, spin bowling rival Shane Warne retired with a slightly superior 'away' record of
                            362 wickets from 73 matches, at an average of 25.50 and a strike rate of 56.7. Due to the
                            variabilities of Test cricket such as grounds played at and opposition played against it is
                            difficult to compare the quality of the top level players and, as such, is very difficult
                            and subjective. However, it is clear that Muralitharan did much better playing at home to
                            test minnows Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, averaging less than 16 runs a wicket.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Muralitharan was on the winning side on 54 of the 133 test matches he played. In
                            those games he captured a total of 438 wickets (8.1 wickets per match), at an outstanding
                            average of 16.18 per wicket and a strike rate of 42.7. Muralitharan took 795 wickets for his
                            country Sri Lanka in 132 tests. The next most wickets for Sri Lanka in these 132 Tests was
                            Chaminda Vaas' 309 – less than 40% of the spinner's pile. No one else managed 100.
                            Collectively Sri Lankan bowlers tallied 1968 wickets across that span, of which Muralitharan
                            accounted for 40.4%. Among the 24 other Sri Lankans who took more than 10 of those wickets,
                            only Lasith Malinga did so at a better strike rate (52.3) than Muralitharan's 54.9 – and the
                            latter bowled rather more overs, 6657.1 of them to be precise.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">On 12 August 1993 Muralitharan made his One Day International (ODI) debut
                            against India at the Khettarama Stadium and took 1 for 38 off ten overs. Pravin Amre was his
                            first ODI wicket.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 27 October 2000 in Sharjah, Muralitharan captured 7 for 30 against India,
                            which were then the best bowling figures in One Day Internationals.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On 9 April 2002 Muralitharan achieved a career peak ODI Bowling Rating of 913,
                            based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin
                            bowler in One Day Internationals. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever
                            ODI bowling ratings.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2006, Muralitharan had the second (now third) highest number of runs (99) hit
                            off him in a One Day International Innings. The Australians, especially Adam Gilchrist,
                            attacked Muralitharan's bowling more than usual that day. Yet, for his performances in 2006,
                            he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.[86] Muralitharan does not have a great record
                            against the Australians in ODIs and this was proved again as he was ineffective in the
                            finals of the 2007 World Cup; his chief tormentor again being Gilchrist.[87] Yet, for his
                            performances in 2007, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.[88][circular reference]
                            He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo for the 2007 World Cup.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Muralitharan played in five Cricket World Cup tournaments, in 1996, 1999, 2003,
                            2007 and 2011. He captured 67 World Cup wickets and is second in the list behind Glenn
                            McGrath who has 71,[90] and represented Sri Lanka in three World Cup finals. In 1996
                            Muralitharan was part Sri Lanka's World Cup winning team that defeated Australia in Lahore,
                            Pakistan. Muralitharan also played in the 2007 World Cup final, when Australia defeated Sri
                            Lanka in Bridgetown, Barbados. He picked up 23 wickets in the 2007 World Cup, and finished
                            as the second highest wicket taker in the tournament behind Glenn McGrath. He was part of
                            the 2011 team who lost the world cup final against India in Mumbai. It was his farewell
                            match as well. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2011 World Cup by the
                            ICC.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Muralitharan has the highest number of career wickets in One Day Internationals,
                            having overtaken Wasim Akram on 5 February 2009. Akram took 502 wickets in 356 matches. On 3
                            February 2009, Muralitharan dismissed Yuvraj Singh in his 327th match, the third ODI against
                            India in Colombo to equal Akram's record. He won 13 Man of the Match awards in this form of
                            the game.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 – 25 February 2001), nicknamed "The Don", was an
                        Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time.
                        Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any
                        sportsman in any major sport.</p>
                    <p>The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of
                        Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took
                        just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of
                        which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression.
                    </p>
                    <p>During a 20-year playing career, Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him, in the
                        words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull, "worth three batsmen to Australia". A
                        controversial set of tactics, known as Bodyline, was specially devised by the England team to
                        curb his scoring. As a captain and administrator, Bradman was committed to attacking,
                        entertaining cricket; he drew spectators in record numbers. He hated the constant adulation,
                        however, and it affected how he dealt with others. The focus of attention on his individual
                        performances strained relationships with some teammates, administrators and journalists, who
                        thought him aloof and wary. Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War, he made a
                        dramatic comeback, captaining an Australian team known as "The Invincibles" on a record-breaking
                        unbeaten tour of England.</p>
                    <p>A complex, highly driven man, not given to close personal relationships, Bradman retained a
                        pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator, selector and writer for three
                        decades following his retirement. Even after he became reclusive in his declining years, his
                        opinion was highly sought, and his status as a national icon was still recognised. Almost 50
                        years after his retirement as a Test player, in 1997, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia
                        called him the "greatest living Australian". Bradman's image has appeared on postage stamps and
                        coins, and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living. On the centenary
                        of his birth, 27 August 2008, the Royal Australian Mint issued a $5 commemorative gold coin with
                        Bradman's image. In 2009, he was inducted posthumously as an inaugural member into the ICC
                        Cricket Hall of Fame.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Playing in only his tenth first-class match, Bradman, nicknamed "Braddles"
                            by his teammates,[28] found his initial Test a harsh learning experience. Caught on a sticky
                            wicket, Australia were all out for 66 in the second innings and lost by 675 runs (still a
                            Test record).[29] Following scores of 18 and 1, the selectors dropped Bradman to twelfth man
                            for the Second Test. An injury to Bill Ponsford early in the match required Bradman to field
                            as substitute while England amassed 636, following their 863 runs in the First Test. RS
                            "Dick" Whitington wrote, "... he had scored only nineteen himself and these experiences
                            appear to have provided him with food for thought".[30] Recalled for the Third Test at the
                            Melbourne Cricket Ground, Bradman scored 79 and 112 to become the youngest player to make a
                            Test century,[31] although the match was still lost. Another loss followed in the Fourth
                            Test. Bradman reached 58 in the second innings and appeared set to guide the team to victory
                            when he was run out.[32] It was to be the only run out of his Test career. The losing margin
                            was just 12 runs.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">The improving Australians did manage to win the Fifth and final Test. Bradman
                            top-scored with 123 in the first innings, and was at the wicket in the second innings when
                            his captain Jack Ryder hit the winning runs. Bradman completed the season with 1,690
                            first-class runs, averaging 93.88, and his first multiple century in a Sheffield Shield
                            match, 340 not out against Victoria, set a new ground record for the SCG. Bradman averaged
                            113.28 in 1929–30.[34] In a trial match to select the team that would tour England, he was
                            last man out in the first innings for 124. As his team followed on, the skipper Bill
                            Woodfull asked Bradman to keep the pads on and open the second innings. By the end of play,
                            he was 205 not out, on his way to 225. Against Queensland at the SCG, Bradman set a then
                            world record for first-class cricket by scoring 452 not out;[36] he made his runs in only
                            415 minutes.</p>

                    <div class="para-container pt-2">
                        <img src="../IMAGES/donengland.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">England were favourites to win the 1930 Ashes series,[39] and if the
                            Australians were to exceed expectations, their young batsmen, Bradman and Jackson, needed to
                            prosper. With his elegant batting technique, Jackson appeared the brighter prospect of the
                            pair.[40] However, Bradman began the tour with 236 at Worcester and went on to score 1,000
                            first-class runs by the end of May, the fifth player (and first Australian) to achieve this
                            rare feat.[41] In his first Test appearance in England, Bradman hit 131 in the second
                            innings but England won the match. His batting reached a new level in the Second Test at
                            Lord's where he scored 254 as Australia won and levelled the series. Later in life, Bradman
                            rated this the best innings of his career as, "practically without exception every ball went
                            where it was intended to go".[42] Wisden noted his fast footwork and how he hit the ball
                            "all round the wicket with power and accuracy", as well as faultless concentration in
                            keeping the ball on the ground.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In terms of runs scored, this performance was soon surpassed. In the Third Test,
                            at Headingley, Bradman scored a century before lunch on 11 July, the first day of the Test
                            match to equal the performances of Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney.[44] In the
                            afternoon, Bradman added another century between lunch and tea, before finishing the day on
                            309 not out. He remains the only Test player to pass 300 in one day's play.[45] His eventual
                            score of 334 was a world-record, exceeding the previous mark of 325 by Andy Sandham.[46]
                            Bradman dominated the Australian innings; the second-highest tally was 77 by Alan Kippax.
                            Businessman Arthur Whitelaw later presented Bradman with a cheque for £1,000 in appreciation
                            of his achievement.[47] The match ended in anti-climax as poor weather prevented a result,
                            as it also did in the Fourth Test.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">A number of English players and commentators noted Bradman's discomfort in
                            playing the short, rising delivery.[6] The revelation came too late for this particular
                            match, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. Australia won the
                            match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With
                            the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found
                            solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a
                            series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero.[49] The statistics
                            Bradman achieved on the tour, especially in the Test matches, broke records for the day and
                            some have stood the test of time. In all, Bradman scored 974 runs at an average of 139.14
                            during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple.[50]
                            As of 2022, no-one has matched or exceeded 974 runs or three double centuries in one Test
                            series; the record of 974 runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69 runs and was
                            achieved in two fewer innings.[51] Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960 runs (at an average of
                            98.66 with 10 centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a
                            tour of England.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">On the tour, the dynamic nature of Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with his
                            quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. He was described as aloof from his teammates and he did
                            not offer to buy them a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw.
                            Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone, writing, as he had sold the rights to a book. On
                            his return to Australia, Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception; he became
                            a "reluctant hero". Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee's newly won fame. They
                            asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in
                            Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, where he received a brand new
                            custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Bradman received a level of adulation that
                            "embarrassed" him. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, "... permanently
                            damaged relationships with his contemporaries". Commenting on Australia's victory, the
                            team's vice-captain Vic Richardson said, "... we could have played any team without Bradman,
                            but we could not have played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett".[53] A modest
                            Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying "I have always endeavoured to do my best for
                            the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of
                            winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia."</p>

                    <p>Teddy Pierre-Marie Riner (/ˈriːnər/, French: [tedi pjɛʁ maʁi ʁinœʁ]; born 7 April 1989) is a
                        French judoka. He has won ten World Championships gold medals, the first and only judoka (male
                        or female) to do so, and three Olympic gold medals (two individual, one team). He has also won
                        five gold medals at the European Championships. He was a member of the Levallois Sporting Club
                        before joining Paris Saint-Germain in August 2017.</p>
                    <p>Riner was born on 7 April 1989 in Les Abymes near Pointe-à-Pitre, in Guadeloupe, an insular
                        region of France in the Caribbean. He was raised in Paris. He was enrolled at a local sports
                        club by his parents and played football, tennis and basketball, but says he preferred judo
                        "because it is an individual sport and it's me, only me."</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Riner was a member of the Levallois Sporting Club in Levallois-Perret,
                            France and is coached by Christian Chaumont and Benoît Campargue.[6] He won the World and
                            European junior titles in 2006.[3] In 2007, he won a gold medal at the European Judo
                            Championships in Belgrade, Serbia, on the day after his eighteenth birthday.[7] At the 2007
                            World Judo Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, he became the youngest ever senior world
                            champion when he won the heavyweight (+100 kg) event, defeating the 2000 Olympic gold
                            medallist, Kosei Inoue of Japan, in the semi-final.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Riner competed in the men's
                            heavyweight event. He received a bye into the second round of the competition before beating
                            Anis Chedli of Tunisia and Kazakhstan's Yeldos Ikhsangaliyev to advance to the semi-finals.
                            In the semis he was beaten by Uzbek judoka Abdullo Tangriev on the golden score, meaning
                            Riner had to enter the repechage rounds.[2] In the repechage he defeated Andreas Tölzer and
                            João Schlittler to reach a bronze medal final against Lasha Gujejiani of Georgia; Riner took
                            the bronze medal by a score of one ippon, one yuko and one koka to nil.[2] In December 2008
                            he won his second World Championship gold medal at the Open weight Championships held in
                            Levallois-Perret, France, by beating Alexander Mikhaylin of Russia in the final.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Riner won his third world title at the 2009 World Championships in Rotterdam,
                            the Netherlands. He won bouts against Daniel McCormick, Vladimirs Osnachs, Ivan Iliev and
                            Martin Padar in the pool stage before beating Marius Paškevičius in the semi-finals and
                            Oscar Bryson in the final to take the gold medal.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2010, he won two medals, a gold and a silver, at the World Championships in
                            Tokyo. After winning the +100 competition Riner was defeated by Daiki Kamikawa of Japan in
                            the final of open weight class by a 2–1 judge's decision. After the bout, Riner refused to
                            bow or to shake Kamikawa's hand, claiming that he "was robbed".</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Riner won his second European gold medal at the 2011 Championships in Istanbul,
                            Turkey. He defeated Nodor Metreveli, Emil Tahirov and Zohar Asaf to win Pool A of the +100
                            kg competition before defeating Estonian Martin Padar in the semi-finals and Barna Bor of
                            Hungary in the final to win the title. At the 2011 World Judo Championships in Paris Riner
                            won the gold medal in men's +100 kg division, beating Germany's Tölzer in the final. The
                            result meant that Riner became the first ever male Judoka to win five world titles. He won
                            his sixth World Championship gold medal as part of the French side that won the team event.
                        </p>
                        <p class="px-2">Riner was selected to compete for France at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London,
                            England in the men's heavyweight event.[5][6] The event took place at ExCeL London on 3
                            August.[19] Riner won the gold medal by defeating Russia's Alexander Mikhaylin in the final.
                        </p>
                        <p class="px-2">At the 2016 Olympics, he defended his Olympics heavyweight title, defeating
                            Hisayoshi Harasawa in the final.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In his career, Riner was only defeated nine times in elite international
                            championships. He lost to Brayson and Tölzer in 2006, to Bianchessi and Rybak in 2007 and to
                            Muneta and Grim Vuijsters in 2008. He lost to Abdullo Tangriev in the third round of the
                            2008 Summer Olympics, before obtaining the bronze medal, and on 13 September 2010 he lost
                            the openweight title at the 2010 World Judo Championships in Tokyo to Daiki Kamikawa, his
                            last defeat before a series of 154 victories. After almost 10 years, he lost in the third
                            round of the Paris Grand Slam against world number 2 Kokoro Kageura.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2021, he won the gold medal in his event at the 2021 Judo World Masters held
                            in Doha, Qatar.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Riner achieved a bronze medal in the over
                            100-kilogram class following a defeat by Russian judoka Tamerlan Bashaev.[25][26] He also
                            won the gold medal in the mixed team event.</p>

                    <p>Yasuhiro Yamashita (山下 泰裕, Yamashita Yasuhiro, born June 1, 1957) is a Japanese judoka. He
                        currently works as an instructor or advisor for numerous organizations, including Tokai
                        University, the International Judo Federation, and the All Japan Judo Federation.He retired from
                        competitive judo on June 17, 1985 after a remarkable career where he won five gold medals in
                        international competitions and marked 203 consecutive victories (with 7 draws in-between) until
                        his retirement. He received the Japanese National Prize of Honor on October 9, 1984.</p>

                        <img src="../IMAGES/yamashitacareer.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Yamashita began judo in primary school after being inspired by judo founder
                            Kanō Jigorō, and had already attained a black belt by the time he reached junior-high
                            school.[1] Yamashita continued judo under the guidance of 1964 Summer Olympics gold medalist
                            Isao Inokuma and 1967 World Judo Championships gold medalist Nobuyuki Sato after graduating
                            from Tokaidai Sagami High School. His streak of 203 victories began in October, 1977, in an
                            exhibition match held in the Soviet Union, and ended with his final match in April, 1985,
                            where he won the All-Japan judo championships for the 9th consecutive time.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Yamashita qualified for the Olympics for the first time in 1976 as a replacement
                            during his freshman year at Tōkai University. At age 19, he became the youngest judoka in
                            history to win the open category of the All-Japan Judo Championships in 1977.[1] He
                            continued his success by winning a gold medal at the 1979 World Judo Championships, and
                            secured a spot on the Japanese Olympic team in a highly publicized draw against 1976 Summer
                            Olympics bronze medalist Sumio Endo. Yamashita went into the final of the 1980 All Japan
                            championships as the favorite, but Endo put Yamashita in a Kani Basami, breaking Yamashita's
                            fibula.[2] The match was declared a draw even though Yamashita was hurt and unable to
                            continue. Kani Basami had been a legal move until the match, but the seriousness of
                            Yamashita's injury caused officials to prohibit its use in international competitions.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Japan boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in protest of the 1979 Soviet invasion
                            of Afghanistan, and Yamashita was forced to look on as a spectator while his rivals competed
                            on the Olympic stage. Yamashita won three more gold medals at the World Championships before
                            qualifying for the Olympics for the third time in 1984. He was the only Japanese judo
                            competitor from the boycott who also qualified for the 1984 Summer Olympics. </p>
                        <p class="px-2">In his only appearance at the Olympics, Yamashita tore a right calf muscle in
                            the preliminary match against Arthur Schnabel. This put Yamashita at a huge disadvantage
                            since he executed his throws by pivoting on his right leg. Though he managed to win the
                            match with an Okuri-Eri-Jime, the injury caused him to visibly limp during the semi-final
                            match against Laurent Del Colombo. Yamashita was thrown with an Osoto Gari only 30 seconds
                            into the match, but managed to return an Osoto Gari and won the match with a
                            Yoko-Shiho-Gatame (side four-quarter hold). He played the final match against Mohamed Ali
                            Rashwan of Egypt. Yamashita won the final and the gold medal despite his injury. The match
                            witnessed a remarkable fair play act from Rashwan who did not aim for Yamashita's right leg.
                            Rashwan was even given an award from the International Fairplay Committee.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Yamashita remained undefeated in both domestic and international competitions,
                            though he drew several matches with two-time Olympic gold medalist Hitoshi Saito. Yamashita
                            faced Saito in the final match of the All-Japan Judo Championships for 3 consecutive years
                            from 1983 to 1985, and emerged victorious in every single one of those matches. After
                            suffering from numerous injuries throughout his career, Yamashita decided to retire from
                            competitive judo on June 17, 1985 at only 28 years of age.</p>

                        and it was an exhibition match held in Russia (then the Soviet Union). The final match that put
                        the pin on his winning streak was at the All Japan Judo Championships in April 1985, which was
                        his 9th victory consecutively.</p>
                    <p>Yasuhiro Yamashita qualified for the 1976 Olympics as a replacement when he was just a freshman
                        at Tokai University. When he was 19 years old, he was the youngest judo practitioner in the
                        history of the world to win the all Japan Judo championship in the open category. </p>
                    <p>In 1979, Yamashita won a gold medal at the World Judo Championship, securing him a sure spot on
                        the Japanese Olympic team. Later, in 1980 at the All Japan Judo Championships, Yasuhiro
                        Yamashita reached the finals and became a fan favorite. He was out against Endo, his opponent,
                        who put him in a Kani Basami, as a finishing move. This broke Yamashita’s fibula in his leg.
                        They declared the match a draw, although Yasuhiro Yamashita could not continue due to his
                        injury. Ever since his injury because of the move, the Kani Basami was prohibited from any
                        future competitions.</p>
                    <p>At the world championships in 1983, Yamashita won the gold medal, which helped qualify him for
                        the Olympics yet again. With all the laurels, Yasuhiro Yamashita remained an undefeated champion
                        in international and national Judo competitions. At his final match at the All Japan Judo
                        Championship in 1985, he emerged victorious, giving him the third consecutive win at the
                        championships.</p>
                    <p>When he was just 28 years old in 1985, Yasuhiro Yamashita decided to retire from competitive Judo
                        due to the numerous injuries his body had endured throughout his career.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Roger Federer (German: [ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss former professional
                        tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for
                        310 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five
                        times. He won 103 ATP singles titles, the second most of all time, including 20 Grand Slam
                        singles titles, a record eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, an Open Era record-tying five
                        men's singles US Open titles, and a record six year-end championships. </p>
                    <p>Federer played during an era where he dominated men's tennis along with Rafael Nadal and Novak
                        Djokovic as the Big Three, collectively considered by some to be the three most successful male
                        tennis players of all time.[c] A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy, Federer
                        won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21.</p>
                    <p>Between 2003 and 2009 Federer played in 21 out of 28 major singles finals. He won three of the
                        four majors and the ATP Finals[d] in 2004, 2006, and 2007 as well as five consecutive titles at
                        both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after
                        three consecutive runner-up finishes to Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27, he
                        surpassed Pete Sampras' record of 14 major men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.</p>
                    <p>Although Federer remained in the Top 3 during most of the early 2010s, the success of Djokovic
                        and Nadal ended his dominance over grass and hard courts, winning two majors between 2010 and
                        2016. During this period of time, he and Stan Wawrinka led the Switzerland Davis Cup team to
                        their first title in 2014, following their Olympic doubles gold victory at the 2008 Beijing
                        Olympics. Federer also won a silver medal in singles at the 2012 London Olympics, where he
                        finished runner-up to Andy Murray. After a half-year hiatus in late 2016 to recover from knee
                        surgery, Federer made a stellar return to tennis, winning three more majors over the next two
                        years, including the 2017 Australian Open over Nadal and an eighth singles title at the 2017
                        Wimbledon Championships. At the 2018 Australian Open, Federer became the first man to win 20
                        major singles titles and shortly the oldest ATP world No. 1 at age 36. In September 2022, he
                        retired from professional tennis following the Laver Cup.</p>
                    <p>A versatile all-court player, Federer's perceived effortlessness has made him highly popular
                        among tennis fans. Originally lacking self-control as a junior, he transformed his on-court
                        demeanor to become well-liked for his general graciousness, winning the Stefan Edberg
                        Sportsmanship Award 13 times. He has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award a record
                        five times. Outside of competing, he played an instrumental role in the creation of the Laver
                        Cup team competition. He is also an active philanthropist. He established the Roger Federer
                        Foundation, which targets impoverished children in southern Africa, and has raised funds in part
                        through the Match for Africa exhibition series. He is routinely one of the top ten highest-paid
                        athletes in any sport and ranked first among all athletes with $100 million in endorsement
                        income in 2020.</p>

                            championship and secured the Orange Bowl junior tournament crown in Miami. The following
                            year Federer made his debut on the Swiss Davis Cup team and became the youngest tennis
                            player (at 18 years 4 months) to end the year among the world’s top 100, finishing that
                            season at number 64.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Federer competed at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, advancing to the bronze
                            medal match. The following year at Wimbledon he defeated Pete Sampras to reach the
                            quarterfinals, and by the end of 2002 he was ranked number six in the world. In 2003 Federer
                            won his first Grand Slam tournament title, at Wimbledon. The following year he captured his
                            first Australian Open and his first U.S. Open and defended his Wimbledon title. A gifted
                            shot maker known for his forehand, he also developed a reputation for composure and
                            sportsmanship. In 2004 Federer was victorious in 11 of the 17 tournaments he played in, and
                            he finished the year ranked number one in the world. His numbers were similarly remarkable
                            in 2005, as he won 11 of 15 tournaments, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. From July
                            2003 to November 2005 he also won a modern-record 24 straight finals.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2006 Federer continued to be the game’s best player. In addition to winning
                            Wimbledon, he was victorious at the Australian Open and the U.S. Open, becoming the first
                            player to win the latter two tournaments three years in a row. He also reached the finals at
                            Roland Garros (the French Open) but was defeated by Rafael Nadal of Spain. In all, Federer
                            competed in 17 tournaments in 2006, capturing 12 titles and reaching the finals in all but
                            one tournament. At the Australian Open in 2007, he won his 10th Grand Slam title. Later that
                            year, however, his bid for his first French Open was again derailed by Nadal, who defeated
                            him in the final. Federer’s rivalry with Nadal continued at Wimbledon in 2007. There he
                            bested Nadal in a thrilling five-set final to become the second male player (after Björn
                            Borg) in more than 100 years to capture five consecutive Wimbledon titles. Federer continued
                            to make history in 2007 when he won his fourth consecutive U.S. Open, a men’s record in the
                            open era.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2008 Federer’s record 65-match grass-court winning streak came to an end when
                            he lost to Nadal in the Wimbledon final. Federer later teamed with Switzerland’s Stan
                            Wawrinka to win the men’s doubles gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Federer lost
                            his number one world ranking to Nadal in August 2008, ending his record run of 237
                            consecutive weeks atop the rankings. The following month Federer won the U.S. Open.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In June 2009 Federer won his first French Open, giving him a championship in
                            each of the four Grand Slam tournaments over the course of his career. Additionally, the win
                            was his 14th Grand Slam title, which tied Federer with Sampras for the most in all time. The
                            following month at Wimbledon, Federer defeated American Andy Roddick in a thrilling marathon
                            five-set match (5–7, 7–6, 7–6, 3–6, 16–14) to win his sixth Wimbledon championship and his
                            record 15th career Grand Slam title; he subsequently regained the world number one ranking.
                            In January 2010 he won the Australian Open, defeating Andy Murray of Great Britain. Federer
                            again defeated Murray in 2012 to win his record-tying seventh career Wimbledon title. A
                            month later the two men faced off in the gold medal match at the London Olympics. This time,
                            however, Federer lost to Murray and had to settle for a silver medal.</p>
                        <img style="float: right;" src="../IMAGES/fedrer2014.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Federer endured an injury-riddled 2013 season, and in 2014 he reached just
                            one Grand Slam final (a loss at Wimbledon to Novak Djokovic). He did still manage a career
                            highlight that year by leading Switzerland to its first-ever Davis Cup victory. In 2015 he
                            appeared in the Wimbledon and U.S. Open finals but lost to Djokovic both times. Shortly
                            after losing in the Wimbledon semifinals in July 2016, he withdrew from the remainder of
                            that tennis season because of a persistent knee injury. </p>
                        <p class="px-2">Federer entered the first Grand Slam tournament of 2017, the Australian Open, as
                            the 17th-ranked men’s player but shocked the tennis world by winning the singles title in an
                            epic five-set final against Nadal. Federer continued his resurgent play at that year’s
                            Wimbledon, where he did not lose a single set during the tournament and won a
                            record-breaking eighth Wimbledon title. Federer’s hot streak continued into 2018 when he won
                            his sixth career Australian Open singles title. With the victory, Federer set a record for
                            most Grand Slam men’s singles titles (20); that mark was later matched by Nadal and
                            Djokovic, and in 2022 Nadal became the first to surpass it. Federer reached the semifinals
                            at the 2019 French Open and advanced to the final at that year’s Wimbledon, where he lost an
                            epic 4-hour 57-minute match (the longest final match in Wimbledon history) to Djokovic.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">After losing in the semifinals at the 2020 Australian Open, Federer had two knee
                            surgeries that caused him to miss the rest of the season. Although he returned in 2021, his
                            play was limited. However, he did compete at Wimbledon, where he lost in straight sets in
                            the quarterfinals. That proved to be his last Grand Slam event. Federer was again sidelined
                            by knee problems, and in September 2022 he announced that he would be retiring after the
                            Laver Cup. Later that month he played in his final competitive match, a doubles event in
                            which he paired with Nadal; they lost.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In addition to tennis, Federer was involved in various philanthropic causes,
                            with a particular interest in South Africa, his mother’s home country. In 2003 he
                            established the Roger Federer Foundation, which sought to help underprivileged children in
                            Switzerland and southern Africa, primarily through educational projects.</p>

                    <p>Federer has won the third most Grand Slam tournament titles (20), trailing Novak Djokovic (21)
                        and Rafael Nadal. He is the first men's singles player to have reached ten consecutive Grand
                        Slam tournament finals and a total of 31 Grand Slam finals.[363][364] He has earned a men's
                        doubles gold medal, and a men's singles silver medal at the Olympics in 2008 and 2012,
                        respectively. He has spent the second-most time at the top of the ATP rankings (310 weeks). He
                        also holds the record for the most titles (6) at the year-end championships, where only the
                        year-end eight highest-ranked players participate. Federer was ranked among the top eight
                        players in the world continuously for 14 years and two weeks — from 14 October 2002 until 31
                        October 2016, when injuries forced him to skip much of the 2016 season. </p>
                    <p>Federer has won the ATP Player of the Year five times (2004–07, 2009), and has been named the ITF
                        World Champion five times (2004–07, 2009). He has won the ATP Fans' Favourite award a record 18
                        times consecutively (2003–20), and the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award (voted for by the
                        players) a record 13 times (2004–09, 2011–17)[367] — both indicative of respect and popularity.
                        He also won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year Award twice (2006, 2013), the Laureus World
                        Sportsman of the Year award five times (2005–08, 2018), and the Laureus World Comeback of the
                        Year award once, following his 2017 comeback season.</p>
                    <p>Federer is one of the founders, via his management company TEAM8, of the Laver Cup; the annual
                        team tennis tournament which pits Europe against the rest of the world. He co-founded the
                        tournament in honor of tennis legend Rod Laver and the inaugural edition was played in 2017.</p>
                    <p>As of 2019 Federer holds the third highest number of Guinness World Records within one

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Rafael Nadal Parera (Catalan: [rəf(ə)ˈɛl nəˈðal pəˈɾeɾə], Spanish: [rafaˈel naˈðal paˈɾeɾa];[4]
                        born 3 June 1986) is a Spanish professional tennis player. He is currently ranked world No. 2 in
                        singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He has been ranked world No. 1 for 209
                        weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal has won an all-time record 22
                        Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14 French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP
                        singles titles, including 36 Masters titles, with 63 of these on clay courts. Nadal is one of
                        only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles.[b] His 81 consecutive wins on clay
                        is the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.</p>
                    <p>For over a decade, Nadal has dominated men's tennis along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic
                        as the Big Three, collectively considered by some to be the three most successful male tennis
                        players of all time.[c] At the start of his professional career, Nadal became one of the most
                        successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching the world No. 2 ranking and winning 16 titles
                        before turning 20, including his first French Open and six Masters events. Nadal became the
                        world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in a historic Wimbledon final,
                        his first major victory off clay. He followed up his win with an Olympic singles gold at the
                        2008 Beijing Olympics. After defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, then-24-year-old
                        Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the first
                        man to win majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass, and clay) in the same year (Surface
                        Slam).</p>
                    <p>After two injury-plagued seasons, Nadal made a stellar return in one of the greatest comeback
                        seasons of all time in 2013; reaching 14 finals, winning two majors and five Masters events
                        including the US Open Series sweep (Summer Slam). He continued his dominance at the French Open,
                        securing six titles, two US Open titles, an Australian Open title, and an Olympic doubles gold
                        at the 2016 Rio Olympics with Marc López. Nadal surpassed his joint-record with Djokovic and
                        Federer for the most major men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became one of
                        four men in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles. He has appeared in the
                        Top 10 of the ATP rankings continuously since April 2005.</p>
                    <p>As a vigorous left-handed player, one of Nadal's main strengths is his forehand, which he hits
                        with extremely heavy topspin at difficult angles. He is one of the best at breaking serve,
                        regularly appearing among the tour leaders in percentage of return games, return points, and
                        break points won. Nadal has won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award five times, and was the
                        Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021. He is also a recipient of the Grand Cross
                        of the Order of Dos De Mayo, the Grand Cross of Naval Merit, and the Medal of the City of Paris.
                        Representing Spain, he has won two Olympic gold medals, and led the nation to five Davis Cup
                        titles. Nadal has also opened a tennis academy in Mallorca, and is an active philanthropist.</p>

                    <div class="para-container pt-2">
                        <img src="../IMAGES/nadalcareer.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Nadal, who officially turned professional in 2001, had appeared in only one
                            Grand Slam tournament as a junior competitor when he reached the semifinals at the 2002
                            Wimbledon Championships. He began his professional career in earnest the next year, breaking
                            into the top 50 in the world. In 2004 he played a crucial role in Spain’s defeat of the
                            United States in the Davis Cup final. Toppling Andy Roddick—then number two in the world—in
                            a four-set opening-day singles clash, Nadal became the youngest player (at 18 years 6
                            months) in the history of the international team competition to win a singles match for a
                            victorious country.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Driving his forehand with a devastatingly potent heavy topspin and covering the
                            court with alacrity, Nadal quickly became one of the top players on the Association of
                            Tennis Professionals (ATP) tour. He also developed a rivalry with world number one Roger
                            Federer. In 2005 Nadal set a record for a teenage male player by registering 11 tournament
                            victories, including a triumph at his French Open (Roland Garros) debut, when he upset
                            Federer in the semifinals. The next year, Nadal secured five more titles on the ATP tour,
                            including his second straight French Open win—this time besting Federer in the final. He
                            also reached his first final on the grass at Wimbledon before falling to Federer.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2007 Nadal extended his victories on clay surfaces to a record 81 consecutive
                            matches before losing to Federer on May 20 in the final of the ATP Masters Series Hamburg
                            (Germany). After bouncing back to win his third title at Roland Garros, Nadal lost to
                            Federer in a grueling five-set Wimbledon final lasting 3 hours 45 minutes. The two met once
                            again in the 2008 French Open final, where Nadal overpowered Federer to win his fourth
                            straight tournament title, tying Björn Borg’s record for consecutive French Open wins. Nadal
                            and Federer met in a third consecutive Wimbledon final in 2008. This time Nadal won his
                            fifth career Grand Slam title—in a five-set match lasting 4 hours 48 minutes, then the
                            longest men’s singles final in Wimbledon history—and thus became the first man since Borg
                            (1980) to collect both the French Open and the Wimbledon title in the same year. In August
                            2008 Nadal won the men’s singles gold medal at the Olympic Games in Beijing, and he took
                            over the number one world ranking from Federer in the same month.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">In 2009 Nadal won his first Australian Open championship after he again
                            bested Federer in a dramatic five-set final match. He set a record for consecutive wins at
                            the French Open the following May, which was then broken at 31 when Nadal was upset in the
                            fourth round of the tournament. At the end of the 2009 tennis season, Nadal helped Spain
                            sweep the Czech Republic in the Davis Cup final. His dominance of the French Open returned
                            in 2010 when he easily won the event for the fifth time in his career, which he followed by
                            winning his second Wimbledon title in July of that year. In September he won his first U.S.
                            Open and thus completed a career Grand Slam by having won all four of the slam’s component
                            tournaments. In 2011 Nadal captured his sixth career French Open title, besting Federer in
                            the final. After losing the next three consecutive Grand Slam finals to Novak Djokovic,
                            Nadal reversed course and defeated Djokovic in the 2012 French Open final to break Borg’s
                            record for the men’s French Open singles championships. He added another French title in
                            2013, becoming the first man to win the same Grand Slam singles event eight times. Later
                            that year he captured a second career U.S. Open singles championship. In 2014 he won a ninth
                            French Open championship.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Nadal was plagued by injuries throughout the remainder of the 2014 season, and
                            he struggled to recover his form in 2015. During that year he failed to win a Grand Slam
                            title, ending his record streak of having captured at least one major tournament in 10
                            straight years. His best performance at a Grand Slam in 2016 was just a fourth-round
                            elimination at the U.S. Open, but Nadal gained a measure of redemption by capturing his
                            second career Olympic gold medal at the Rio de Janeiro Games. He advanced to his first Grand
                            Slam final in three years at the 2017 Australian Open, where he lost a thrilling five-set
                            match to Federer. Nadal ended his Grand Slam title drought when he won a 10th career French
                            Open championship in June 2017. Three months later he won his third U.S. Open singles title.
                            At the 2018 Australian Open, Nadal was forced to withdraw in the quarterfinals because of an
                            injury, but he recovered in time to claim another French Open championship, which was his
                            17th Grand Slam title.</p>
                        <img src="../IMAGES/nadal2014.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">After losing the Australian Open final in 2019, Nadal continued his
                            dominance at Roland Garros that year by capturing his 12th career French Open singles
                            championship. He later won the 2019 U.S. Open singles title, which was his 19th career Grand
                            Slam championship, the second most for men behind Federer’s 20 titles. The following year he
                            tied Federer when he won his 13th French Open title. (Their record was equaled in July 2021
                            by Djokovic.) After losing in the semifinals of the French Open in 2021, Nadal missed most
                            of the year’s remaining tournaments, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, because of a
                            foot injury. He entered the 2022 Australian Open with low expectations, but he stunned many
                            observers by overcoming a two-set deficit to defeat Russia’s Daniil Medvedev in the final
                            and claim his 21st Grand Slam title. Some four months later Nadal won his 14th career French
                            Open championship. His strong play continued at Wimbledon, but an abdominal injury forced
                            him to withdraw before his semifinal match.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Novak Djokovic (Serbian Cyrillic: Новак Ђоковић, romanized: Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôʋaːk
                        dʑôːkoʋitɕ] (listen);[6] born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player. He is
                        currently ranked world No. 7 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He has
                        been ranked world No. 1 for a record total 373 weeks,[7] and has finished as the year-end No. 1
                        a record seven times.[8] He has won 21 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record nine
                        Australian Open titles. Overall, he has won 90 ATP singles titles, which include a record 64 Big
                        Titles and a record 38 Masters titles. Djokovic has completed a non-calendar year Grand Slam in
                        singles, becoming the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of the four majors
                        at once across three different surfaces. He is also the first man in the Open Era to achieve a
                        double Career Grand Slam in singles and the only player to complete the Career Golden Masters in
                        singles on the ATP Tour, which he has done twice.</p>
                    <p>Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. At age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer's and
                        Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors to win his first major title at the 2008
                        Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic also separated himself from the rest of the field to join
                        Federer and Nadal in the Big Three, collectively considered by some to be the three most
                        successful male tennis players of all time.[b] In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first
                        time, winning three out of the four majors and five Masters titles. He remained the most
                        successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade, leading the tour at majors,
                        Masters, and Year-end Championships. In 2015, Djokovic had his most successful season, reaching
                        15 consecutive finals and winning a season-record 10 Big Titles – three majors, six Masters, and
                        the Year-end Championships. His dominant run extended until the 2016 French Open where he
                        completed a non-calendar year Grand Slam and his first Career Grand Slam, becoming the first man
                        since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors at once and setting a record for most ranking
                        points (16,950) accumulated as world No. 1.</p>
                    <p>Representing Serbia, Djokovic led the Serbian national team to their first Davis Cup title in
                        2010 and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. Moreover, he won the bronze medal for Serbia at
                        the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Djokovic has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award four
                        times (2012, 2015, 2016, 2019), the BBC Sports Personality World Sport Star of the Year award in
                        2011 and the L'Équipe Champion of Champions award in 2021. He is also a recipient of the Order
                        of St. Sava, the Order of Karađorđe's Star, and the Order of the Republika Srpska.</p>
                    <p>Beyond competition, Djokovic is an active philanthropist[12] and a former ATP player council
                        president.[13] In August 2020, Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil announced the formation of the
                        Professional Tennis Players Association as the first player-only association in tennis, citing
                        the need for players to have more influence on the tour and advocating better prize money
                        structure for lower ranked players.</p>

                    <div class="para-container pt-2">
                        <img src="../IMAGES/novakcareer.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Djokovic entered the top 100 of the Association of Tennis Professionals
                            (ATP) at age 18, and in July 2006 he won his first ATP event. After advancing to the
                            semifinals at both the French Open and Wimbledon in 2007, he reached the finals of that
                            year’s U.S. Open but lost in straight sets to Roger Federer. Djokovic’s hot play continued
                            into 2008 as he won his first Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open, thereby becoming
                            the first Serbian man to win one of tennis’s four most prestigious singles championships.
                            Later that year he captured a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Djokovic’s progress plateaued for almost three years, as he won just 10 ATP
                            men’s singles tournaments and reached only one Grand Slam final (the 2010 U.S. Open) between
                            February 2008 and the end of 2010. His fortunes turned in December 2010 when he led the
                            Serbian Davis Cup team to the country’s first Davis Cup title. His Davis Cup victories
                            marked the beginning of a 43-match winning steak—the third longest such streak in the Open
                            era (since 1968)—which included a second Australian Open title in January 2011. Djokovic’s
                            remarkable streak ended with a French Open semifinal loss to Federer, but his strong play
                            helped him rise to the number one world ranking shortly after he defeated Rafael Nadal to
                            capture the 2011 Wimbledon championship. Djokovic later defeated Nadal in the U.S. Open
                            final to claim his third Grand Slam title of the year.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">At the Australian Open in 2012, he again bested Nadal, winning a five-set
                            thriller that lasted nearly six hours. The two met for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam
                            final at the 2012 French Open, where Djokovic lost to Nadal in four sets. In 2013 Djokovic
                            defeated Andy Murray to win his fourth Australian Open title, and he captured another
                            Wimbledon championship the following year when he beat Federer in a dramatic five-set final.
                            In 2015 he beat Murray to capture his fifth career Australian Open, which made Djokovic the
                            all-time leader in Australian Open men’s singles championships during the Open era. After a
                            loss in the 2015 French Open final, the top-ranked Djokovic bested Federer to win his third
                            Wimbledon championship. He continued his hot play at the U.S. Open, beating Federer in the
                            final to capture his 10th career Grand Slam title. Djokovic ran his winning streak in Grand
                            Slam matches to 21 when he beat Murray in straight sets in the final of the 2016 Australian
                            Open. At the 2016 French Open he again bested Murray in a Grand Slam final. By winning his
                            first French Open championship, Djokovic achieved a career Grand Slam.</p>
                        <img style="float: right;" src="../IMAGES/novak2016.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Djokovic reached the finals of the 2016 U.S. Open but lost a four-set match
                            to Switzerland’s Stan Wawrinka. He failed to advance past the quarterfinals in the first
                            three Grand Slam tournaments of 2017, and in July he announced that he would not play the
                            remainder of the year in order to treat an elbow injury that had been bothering him for the
                            previous 18 months. He returned to play in January 2018. Djokovic slowly improved throughout
                            the year, and in July he won his fourth career Wimbledon title. Two months later he captured
                            his third U.S. Open singles championship. In January 2019 Djokovic won his seventh career
                            Australian Open singles title, the most in the history of that tournament. He then defended
                            his Wimbledon title in epic fashion, defeating Federer in a 4-hour 57-minute final (the
                            longest singles final in tournament history) that was decided in an unprecedented tiebreaker
                            after the fifth set ended in a 12–12 tie.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2020 Djokovic continued to dominate at the Australian Open, winning his 17th
                            Grand Slam title. Although Wimbledon was canceled that year because of the COVID-19
                            pandemic, the French Open was held in the fall. He reached the finals there but lost to
                            Nadal. Djokovic claimed yet another title when he won the Australian Open in 2021. In June
                            of that year he won his second French Open singles championship. Djokovic’s hot streak
                            continued when he won another Wimbledon title in July 2021, which gave him 20 total Grand
                            Slam men’s singles championships, tying the all-time record that was shared by Federer and
                            Nadal. Later that year he entered the U.S. Open, hoping to become the third male player to
                            win all four Grand Slam events in one calendar year. Although he reached the finals,
                            Djokovic was defeated in straight sets by Daniil Medvedev of Russia.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Djokovic sought to make history at the 2022 Australian Open by winning his 21st
                            Grand Slam men’s singles title. However, he became embroiled in a dispute involving
                            Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for those entering the country. The unvaccinated
                            Djokovic was initially granted an exemption, but it came under scrutiny amid a public
                            uproar. His visa was ultimately canceled, and Djokovic was deported before the tournament
                            began. Nadal ended up winning the men’s event to surpass Djokovic and Federer for most Grand
                            Slam titles. Later in 2022 Djokovic competed at the French Open, where he lost in the
                            quarterfinals to Nadal, who went on to win the tournament. In July Djokovic turned around
                            his disappointing season by winning Wimbledon to claim his 21st Grand Slam championship.</p>

                    <p>Marc Márquez Alentà (born 17 February 1993) is a Spanish professional Grand Prix motorcycle road
                        racer, who has raced for Honda's factory team since his MotoGP debut in 2013. Born in Cervera,
                        Catalonia, Spain, he is nicknamed the 'Ant of Cervera' worldwide (due to his height of 1.68m),
                        and 'el tro de Cervera' in his hometown, meaning the 'Thunder of Cervera'. He is one of four
                        riders to have won world championship titles in three different categories, after Mike Hailwood,
                        Phil Read and Valentino Rossi, and is one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time,
                        with eight Grand Prix World Championships to his name, six of which are in the premier class.
                        Márquez became the third Spaniard after Àlex Crivillé and Jorge Lorenzo to win the premier class
                        title, and is the most successful Spanish rider in MotoGP to date, with 59 wins. In 2013 he
                        became the first rider since Kenny Roberts in 1978 to win the premier class title in his first
                        season, and the youngest to win the title overall, at 20 years and 266 days of age.</p>
                    <p>Márquez is often considered one of the greatest innovators of modern MotoGP racing,[2] due to his
                        comparatively exaggerated cornering technique of leaning so far over the bike, that he seems to
                        be "in constant danger of sliding out". He is the older brother of 2014 Moto3 world champion and
                        2019 Moto2 world champion Álex Márquez.</p>
                    <p>Márquez won the 2010 125cc World Championship, the 2012 Moto2 World Championship, and the 2013,
                        2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 MotoGP World Championships. He became the first rider since
                        Kenny Roberts in 1978 to win the premier class title in his rookie season, and the youngest to
                        secure the title overall. In 2014 he defended his title, winning the championship with three
                        rounds to spare,[9] during which he won ten races in a row. Márquez equalled the all-time Grand
                        Prix record for pole positions at the age of 23 in 2016.[10] Márquez secured the 2016 title with
                        three rounds to spare at Motegi and sealed the title at Valencia in the final round of 2017. He
                        then went on to win the 2018 title with three races to spare and became the third highest all
                        time Grand Prix winner. He secured the 2019 title with four races to spare at the Chang
                        International Circuit in Buriram, Thailand, marking his 8th World Championship and 6th in the
                        Premier Class. Márquez missed almost all of the compressed and delayed 2020 season (he completed
                        26 laps of the first race, before falling) as well as the start of the 2021 season because of a
                        broken right arm sustained in the 2020 season opener.[11] After returning in the 2021 season, he
                        won three races in Germany, Austin, Misano, and had a further 2nd place in Aragon, but due to
                        him missing the opening two, and the last two races of the season, only finished 7th overall.

                            and the 85cc Catalan Supermotard Championship, and met Emilio Alzamora. In 2006, he won the

                            finished eight overall. In 2007, still in the CEV Championship, he moved to KTM, but
                            finished ninth overall due to several crashes.</p>

                            sustained in pre-season. His first race was the 2008 Portuguese Grand Prix in Estoril.
                            During his sixth race, at the British Grand Prix, he finished third and became the youngest

                            initially had to steal away to compete, first in hill climb events and then in road racing,
                            as his father did not approve of his son's motorcycle racing career and did everything he
                            could to persuade him not to race.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Eventually his father came to terms with his racing and Agostini won the 1963
                            Italian 175cc championship aboard a Morini. He got his break when Morini factory rider
                            Tarquinio Provini left the team to ride for Benelli. Count Alfonso Morini hired the young
                            Agostini to ride for him.[1] In 1964, Agostini would win the Italian 350cc title and proved
                            his ability by finishing fourth in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">These results caught the eye of Count Domenico Agusta, who signed Agostini to
                            ride for his MV Agusta squad as Mike Hailwood's teammate.[1] Agostini then fought a
                            season-long battle with Honda's Jim Redman for the 1965 350cc world championship. He seemed
                            to have the title won when he led the final round in Japan at Suzuka when his bike failed
                            him, handing the title to Redman.</p>

                            class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">At the end of the 1965 season, Hailwood left to join Honda as he had tired
                            of working for the difficult Count Agusta. With Agostini now the top MV Agusta rider, he
                            responded by winning the 500cc title seven years in succession for the Italian factory.He
                            would also win the 350cc title seven times in succession and won 10 Isle of Man TTs. At the
                            time, the Isle of Man TT and the Ulster Grand Prixs were regularly won by Anglophonic
                            (mostly British) riders; in addition to Agostini's successes at the TT he also won 7 Ulster
                            Grand Prix races- he was the only non-British rider to achieve the same kind of success in
                            these British motorcycle races- which were 2 of the most difficult motorcycle races in the
                            world at the time. In 1967 he battled Hailwood in one of the most dramatic seasons in Grand
                            Prix history. Each rider had 5 victories before the championship was decided in Agostini's
                            favor at the last race of the season.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Agostini dropped a bombshell on the Grand Prix world when he announced he would
                            never again race at the Isle of Man TT, after the death of his close friend, Gilberto
                            Parlotti during the 1972 TT. He considered the 37 mile circuit unsafe for world championship
                            competition. At the time, the TT was the most prestigious race on the motorcycling calendar.
                            Other top riders joined his boycott of the event and by 1977, the event was struck from the
                            Grand Prix schedule.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Agostini surprised the racing world when he announced that he would leave MV
                            Agusta to ride for Yamaha in 1974 season. On his first outing for the Japanese factory, he
                            won the prestigious Daytona 200, the premiere American motorcycle race. He went on to claim
                            the 1974 350cc World Championship but injuries and mechanical problems kept him from winning
                            the 500cc crown. He rebounded and won the 1975 500cc title, marking the first time a
                            two-stroke machine won the premier class.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">The 1975 championship would also be the last world title for the 33-year-old
                            Italian. In 1976, he rode both Yamaha and MV bikes in the 500cc class, yet raced only once
                            in the 350cc to win in Assen. For the challenging Nürburgring, he chose the 500cc MV Agusta
                            and took it to victory, winning the last Grand Prix for both himself, the marque and the
                            last for four-stroke engines in the 500cc class.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">He retired from motorcycle competition after finishing 6th in the 1977 season in
                            which he also raced in 750cc endurance races for Yamaha.</p>
                        <h4 class="pt-2 px-2">As A Manager</h4>
                        <img src="../IMAGES/agostinimanager.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">In 1982, Agostini returned to motorcycle racing as the Marlboro Yamaha team
                            manager. In this role he won three 500cc titles with Eddie Lawson and managed many
                            successful riders including Graeme Crosby and Kenny Roberts. Under his management riders won
                            the 1982 Daytona Formula 1 (Crosby), 1983 and 1984 Daytona Formula 1 (Roberts) and 1986
                            Daytona Superbike championships (Lawson). Between 1986 and 1990 he also managed the Marlboro
                            Yamaha 250cc team with riders like Luca Cadalora, Martin Wimmer and Àlex Crivillé.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Since 1992, he served as the Cagiva factory racing team manager until 1994, when
                            Cagiva withdrew from the world championship. Agostini's last season as team manager was 1995
                            when he managed a 250cc Honda team with Doriano Romboni as rider.</p>

                    <p>Charles Frederick "Karch" Kiraly (/ˈkɑːrtʃ kɪˈraɪ/) (born November 3, 1960) is an American
                        volleyball player, coach and broadcast announcer. In the 1980s he was a central part of the U.S
                        National Team that won gold medals at the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games. He went on to win the
                        gold medal again at the 1996 Olympic Games, the first Olympic competition to feature beach
                        volleyball. He is the only player (man or woman) to have won Olympic medals of any color in both
                        the indoor and beach volleyball categories. He played college volleyball for the UCLA Bruins,
                        where his teams won three national championships under head coach Al Scates.</p>
                    <p>Kiraly is currently the head coach of the United States women's national volleyball team leading
                        them to their first-ever gold medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and thereby completing the
                        "triple crown" of coaching an Olympic gold medal winning team as well as personally winning gold
                        medals in both indoor and beach volleyball.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Kiraly joined the national team in 1981. Playing outside hitter, he proved
                            to be an extremely solid passer. Along with teammate Aldis Berzins, Kiraly was the
                            foundation for the "two-man" serve reception system Doug Beal created in 1983.[13] Along
                            with covering half the court on serve receive and consistently delivering the ball to team
                            setter Dusty Dvorak, Kiraly proved to be an excellent defender and a highly productive
                            outside hitter. Kiraly led the U.S National Team to the gold medal at the 1984 Summer
                            Olympics, overcoming a pool play loss to Brazil to defeat Brazil in the finals. Kiraly was
                            the youngest player on the gold medal team.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">The US National team showed their place as the world's best team by winning the
                            1985 FIVB World Cup, followed by the 1986 FIVB World Championship. In the 1988 Summer
                            Olympics the team won its second Olympic gold medal, this time defeating the USSR in the
                            championship match. Kiraly was selected as a captain for the 1988 team at Seoul. FIVB named
                            Kiraly the top player in the world in 1986 and 1988.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Following the 1988 Olympics, Kiraly retired from the national team. He and
                            teammate Steve Timmons played professional volleyball for Il Messaggero Ravenna in Italy
                            from 1990 to 1992.[10] The team included Italians Fabio Vullo and Andrea Gardini, Roberto
                            Masciarelli and Stefano Margutti as team members. In two seasons the team won a series of
                            titles, including the Italian Volleyball League (1991), the Italian Cup (1991), FIVB
                            Volleyball Men's Club World Championship (1991), CEV Champions League (1992), and the
                            European Supercup (1992).</p>
                        <h4 class="pt-2 px-2">Career In Beach Volleyball</h4>
                        <img src="../IMAGES/kiralybeach.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Kiraly had a long career on the professional beach circuit, and with 148
                            career tournaments won is the 'winningest' player in the sport's history. He won at least
                            one tournament in 24 of the 28 seasons he played in a career that spanned four decades. He
                            claimed titles with 13 partners, and in domestic events he made it to the semifinals over
                            80% of the time. Kiraly competed into his mid-40s.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Kiraly played in his first beach tournament at age 11 as his father's partner.
                            Kiraly has said as an 11-year-old he was thrilled to discover in beach volleyball he could
                            compete with grown men on even terms. He earned his A and AA rating on the beach at the age
                            of 15 and his AAA rating at 17. Kiraly's first big beach breakthrough came at Hermosa Beach
                            in 1978. As a 17-year-old who had just graduated from high school, he shocked Hermosa
                            onlookers by gaining the finals before he and partner Marco Ortega lost to the day's
                            dominant team on the beach, Jim Menges and Greg Lee. In the early 1980s, Kiraly made a
                            successful beach team pairing with UCLA teammate Sinjin Smith. The partnership split up as
                            Kiraly came to focus on the U.S National Team.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 1992, Kiraly left his indoor career behind, returning to the U.S. to play
                            beach volleyball full-time on the AVP tour. Kiraly chose Kent Steffes as his doubles
                            partner. Steffes was a talented younger player who had left UCLA early to start playing on
                            the professional beach tour. Kiraly and Steffes soon became the dominant pairing on the
                            tour, supplanting former teammate and doubles partner Smith and his partner Randy Stoklos as
                            the beach's top team. In 1996 Kiraly returned to the Olympics, this time competing in beach
                            volleyball with his partner, Steffes. Kiraly and Steffes won the gold medal, the first ever
                            awarded for men's beach volleyball.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Kiraly continued to win tournaments into his 40s, recording two AVP tournament
                            victories with his partner Brent Doble in 2002 and 2003, and four more with Mike Lambert in
                            2004 and 2005. Kiraly's last victory came in August 2005, when he and Lambert won at
                            Huntington Beach. In 2006, Kiraly partnered with Larry Witt, and in 2007 partnered with
                            Kevin Wong. His teams continued to make high placings. Over his career on the beach, Kiraly
                            won over $3 million in prize money, and earned considerably more in endorsements. Kiraly
                            retired from the AVP tour after the 2007 season.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Ultimately Kiraly won 148 professional beach volleyball titles, 74 of them with
                            Steffes.[12] The next closest player in total wins is Sinjin Smith at 139. Following Smith
                            is his longtime partner, Randy Stoklos, at 122. The next closest player is Kent Steffes at
                            110, followed by Emanuel Rego, with 78 wins.</p>
                        <h4 class="pt-2 px-2">Coaching Career</h4>
                        <img style="float: right;" src="../IMAGES/kiralycoaching.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2">Kiraly resides in Heber City, Utah, with his wife Janna and two sons, Kristian
                            and Kory. His father, Laszlo Kiraly, played for the Hungarian junior national volleyball
                            team.[2] Kiraly studied biochemistry in college, and considered pursuing a career in
                            medicine after completing college.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Kiraly babysat Misty May-Treanor when she was a youngster. On the same day
                            Kiraly led the national team to their historic gold medal win at the 2020 Summer Olympics,
                            he revealed that he was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2017 and had to have doctors remove
                            part of his colon in order to fight the disease. Trying to keep the team in good working
                            order, he did not want to make his team feel sad and decided not to share the news with them
                            until he went into cancer remission in 2021.</p>

                        <img src="../IMAGES/contecareer.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Facundo's first participation with the Argentine national volleyball team
                            took place during the U19 World Championship (4th place) in 2007. He debuted at the senior
                            level during the 2008 America's Cup, held in Brazil (4th place). Conte was also a part of
                            the junior national team that won the 2008 South American Championship, defeating Brazil in
                            the final and breaking a 26–year period without winning the tournament.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2009, Conte played his first World League, finishing 5th with Argentina.
                            After that participation, the player joined Italian team Zinella Bologna, where he was
                            coached by his father Hugo.[4] During that year, Conte also helped Argentina finish third at
                            the U21 World Championship, the country's best position in the history of the tournament.
                        </p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2010, Conte participated at the World League, but this time Argentina was
                            unsuccessful, losing all 14 games. In September of that year, Conte was selected by coach
                            Javier Weber to participate at the World Championship.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 2015, Conte won a gold medal of the 2015 Pan American Games. In 2013, he
                            signed a contract with Polish club PGE Skra Bełchatów. He won a title of the Polish Champion
                            in 2014. On 8 October 2014, his team won the Polish SuperCup.[6] In February 2015, he signed
                            a new two–year contract with Skra until 2017.[7] On 7 February 2016, alongside Skra, he won
                            the Polish Cup after beating ZAKSA in the final. On 29 April 2016, he left team from
                            Bełchatów.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">After competing in PlusLiga for three seasons, Conte signed a contract with
                            Shanghai Golden Age, playing there for 2 seasons. In 2017, he was transferred to El Jaish in
                            Qatar for the Qatar Cup and Emir Cup competitions.</p>

                    <p>Renan Dal Zotto (born July 19, 1960) is a Brazilian former volleyball player who competed in
                        three editions of the Summer Olympics and currently head coach of Brazil men's national
                        volleyball team. He was born in São Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul. In 1980 he was part of the
                        Brazilian team which finished fifth in the Olympic tournament. He played five matches.</p>
                    <p>Four years later he won the silver medal with the Brazilian team in the 1984 Olympic tournament.
                        He played all six matches. At the 1988 Games he was a member of the Brazilian team which
                        finished fourth in the 1988 Olympic tournament. He played all seven matches. As coach he worked
                        mostly with clubs in Brazil, plus a season in Italy, all in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2017 he was
                        appointed as the new head coach of the Brazil men's team, replacing Bernardo Rezende who was in
                        office during the last sixteen years.</p>
                    <p>He was also disciplined by the FIVB when cameras clearly showed him intentionally rolling a ball
                        on court mid rally. This was during an important 5th set in 2018 vs Russia. In his statement he
                        failed to apologize for the incident or admit fault.</p>
                    <p>Renan Dal Zotto is one of the greatest indoor players to ever come out of Brazil, if not among
                        the greatest players in the world, and he certainly has the credentials to back that up. Renan
                        had a 13-year career wearing Brazil’s green and yellow jersey starting at age 16 in 1976. The
                        following year he played in his first FIVB international event, the 1977 World Cup. By 1981,
                        Renan was voted best defender and best passer in the world by the FIVB. He earned four trips to
                        the Olympic Games in 1980, 1984, 1988 and 1992. After a fifth-place finish at his initial
                        Olympics in 1980 at the age of 20, he paced Brazil to the silver medal at the 1984 Olympic Games
                        in Los Angeles. Two years earlier Renan sparked Brazil to the silver medal at the 1982 FIVB
                        World Championship in Argentina.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="pt-2">Among his other honors are three South American Championship titles in a four-year
                        span playing with Brazil and the 1983 Pan American Games gold medal. As a part of Brazil’s
                        “Silver Generation”, he represented his country in three FIVB World Cups, two FIVB World
                        Championships and three Pan American Games. Following five seasons playing professionally for
                        three different clubs in his native Brazil, Renan transferred to Italy. He played for Maxicono
                        Parma for four years starting with the 1988-89 season before moving on to Messaggero Ravenna for
                        one season in 1992-93. Maxicono Parma won the inaugural FIVB Men’s Club World Championship held
                        in 1989. Renan was part of two Italian league championships and two Italia Cup titles in 1990
                        and 1992, three European Super Cup titles in 1989, 1990 and 1992, and the 1993 European
                        Champions Cup title during his five club seasons in Italy.</p>
                    <p>When he returned from Italy, Renan ended his career as a player and went on to lead the
                        Palmeiras/Parmalat of the Brazilian Super League as its coach. He currently serves as a
                        selections director for the Brazilian Volleyball Federation. In 2001 Renan received the titles
                        of most spectacular player in the world, best defender in the world and world’s best spiker of
                        the 20th century while being one of the FIVB’s finalists for best player of the 20th Century.
                        Because of Renan Dal Zotto’s highly decorated career and status as one the most dynamic players
                        to ever play the sport, we are honored to welcome him into our 2015 Class of Inductees into the
                        International Volleyball Hall of Fame.</p>

                    <p>Eldrick Tont "Tiger" Woods (born December 30, 1975) is an American professional golfer. He is
                        tied for first in PGA Tour wins, ranks second in men's major championships, and holds numerous
                        golf records.[4] Woods is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time and is one
                        of the most famous athletes in modern history.[4] He is an inductee of the World Golf Hall of
                        Fame.</p>
                    <p>Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur golf career, Woods turned professional in
                        1996 at the age of 20. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to
                        his first major, the 1997 Masters, which he won by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance.
                        He reached number one in the world rankings for the first time in June 1997, less than a year
                        after turning pro. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Woods was the dominant force
                        in golf. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264
                        consecutive weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 consecutive weeks). During this
                        time, he won 13 of golf's major championships.</p>
                    <p>The next decade of Woods's career was marked by comebacks from personal problems and injuries. He
                        took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 in an
                        attempt to resolve marital issues with his wife at the time, Elin. Woods admitted to multiple
                        infidelities, and the couple eventually divorced.[6] He fell to number 58 in the world rankings
                        in November 2011 before ascending again to the number-one ranking between March 2013 and May
                        2014.[7][8] However, injuries led him to undergo four back surgeries between 2014 and 2017.[9]
                        Woods competed in only one tournament between August 2015 and January 2018, and he dropped off
                        the list of the world's top 1,000 golfers.[10][11] On his return to regular competition, Woods
                        made steady progress to the top of the game, winning his first tournament in five years at the
                        Tour Championship in September 2018 and his first major in 11 years at the 2019 Masters.</p>
                    <p>Woods has held numerous golf records. He has been the number one player in the world for the most
                        consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer in history. He has
                        been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record 11 times[12] and has won the Byron Nelson Award for
                        lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times. Woods has the record of leading the money
                        list in ten different seasons. He has won 15 professional major golf championships (trailing
                        only Jack Nicklaus, who leads with 18) and 82 PGA Tour events (tied for first all time with Sam
                        Snead).[13] Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins. Woods
                        is the fifth (after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus) player to achieve
                        the career Grand Slam, and the youngest to do so. He is also the second golfer (after Nicklaus)
                        to achieve a career Grand Slam three times.</p>
                    <p>Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships. He was also part of the American winning team for the
                        1999 Ryder Cup. In May 2019, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Donald
                        Trump, the fourth golfer to receive the honor.</p>
                    <p>On February 23, 2021, Woods was hospitalized in serious but stable condition after a single-car
                        collision and underwent emergency surgery to repair compound fractures sustained in his right
                        leg in addition to a shattered ankle.[15] In an interview with Golf Digest in November 2021,
                        Woods indicated that his full-time career as a professional golfer was over, although he would
                        continue to play "a few events per year".[16] He returned to the PGA Tour for the first time
                        since the car crash at the 2022 Masters.</p>

                        <p>Woods turned professional at age 20 in August 1996 and immediately signed advertising deals
                            with
                            Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf
                            history
                            at that time.[61][62] Woods was named Sports Illustrated's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and
                            PGA
                            Tour Rookie of the Year.[63] On April 13, 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, in
                            record-breaking fashion and became the tournament's youngest winner at age 21.[64] Two
                            months
                            later, he set the record for the fastest ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf
                            Ranking.[65]
                            After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including the PGA
                            Championship, a feat not achieved since Johnny Miller did it in 1974.</p>
                        <p>Woods was severely myopic; his eyesight had a rating of 11 diopters. In order to correct this
                            problem, he underwent successful laser eye surgery in 1999,[68] and he immediately resumed
                            winning tour events. In 2007, his vision again began to deteriorate, and he underwent laser
                            eye
                            surgery a second time.</p>
                        <p>In 2000, Woods won six consecutive events on the PGA Tour, which was the longest winning
                            streak
                            since Ben Hogan did it in 1948. One of these was the U.S. Open, where he broke or tied nine
                            tournament records in what Sports Illustrated called "the greatest performance in golf
                            history",
                            in which Woods won the tournament by a record 15-stroke margin and earned a check for
                            $800,000.[70] At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam.[71]
                            At
                            the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken
                            the
                            record for lowest scoring average in tour history. He was named the Sports Illustrated
                            Sportsman
                            of the Year, the only athlete to be honored twice, and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as
                            the
                            twelfth-best golfer of all time</p>
                        <p>When Woods won the 2001 Masters, he became the only player to win four consecutive major
                            professional golf titles, although not in the same calendar year. This achievement came to
                            be
                            known as the "Tiger Slam".[73] Following a stellar 2001 and 2002 in which he continued to
                            dominate the tour, Woods's career hit a slump.[66][74] He did not win a major in 2003 or
                            2004.
                            In September 2004, Vijay Singh overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Rankings, ending
                            Woods's record streak of 264 weeks at No. 1</p>
                        <p>Woods rebounded in 2005, winning six PGA Tour events and reclaiming the top spot in July
                            after
                            swapping it back and forth with Singh over the first half of the year.Woods began dominantly
                            in
                            2006, winning his first two PGA tournaments but failing to capture his fifth Masters
                            championship in April.[77] Following the death of his father in May, Woods took some time
                            off
                            from the tour and appeared rusty upon his return at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot Golf Club,
                            where he missed the cut.[78] However, he quickly returned to form and ended the year by
                            winning
                            six consecutive tour events. At the season's close, Woods had 54 total wins that included 12
                            majors; he broke the tour records for both total wins and total majors wins over eleven
                            seasons.
                        </p>
                        <p>Woods continued to excel in 2007 and the first part of 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee
                            surgery and missed the next two months on the tour.[80] Woods returned for the 2008 U.S.
                            Open,
                            where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic sudden death victory over
                            Rocco Mediate that followed an 18-hole playoff, after which Mediate said, "This guy does
                            things
                            that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination," and Kenny Perry added, "He beat
                            everybody on one leg."[81] Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder
                            of
                            the season due to additional knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than
                            previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods
                            called
                            it "my greatest ever championship."[82] In Woods's absence, television ratings for the
                            remainder
                            of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.</p>
                        <p>Woods had a much anticipated return to golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback
                            included a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but he failed to win a major,
                            the
                            first year since 2004 that he did not do so.[84] After his marital infidelities came to
                            light
                            and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods
                            announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf.[6]
                            In
                            February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior, saying "I was wrong and I
                            was
                            foolish."[85] During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods
                        </p>
                        <p>Woods returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters, where he finished tied for fourth
                            place.[87] He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and
                            the
                            Players Championship, where he withdrew in the fourth round, citing injury.[88] Shortly
                            afterward, Hank Haney, Woods's coach since 2003, resigned the position. In August, Woods
                            hired
                            Sean Foley as Haney's replacement. The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed
                            to
                            win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless
                            finishing
                            the season ranked No. 2 in the world.</p>
                        <p>In 2011, Woods's performance continued to suffer; this took its toll on his ranking. After
                            falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters,
                            where he tied for fourth place.[89] Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed
                            several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddie Steve Williams
                            (who
                            was shocked by the dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell
                            until
                            he hired Joe LaCava.[90] After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to
                            falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58.[8] He rose to No. 50 in mid-November
                            after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak
                            with a
                            victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.</p>
                        <p>Woods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and
                            the
                            AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) where he started off well but struggled on the final
                            rounds.
                            Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out in the second
                            round by missing a 5-foot putt,[92] Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second
                            at
                            The Honda Classic, with the lowest final-round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short
                            time
                            off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on
                            the
                            PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal
                            performances,
                            Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus
                            in
                            second place for most PGA Tour victories;[93] a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a
                            win
                            at the AT&T National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.</p>
                        <p>The year 2013 brought a return of Woods's dominating play. In January, he won the Farmers
                            Insurance Open by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win. It was the seventh time he won the
                            event.[95] In March, he won the WGC-Cadillac Championship, also for the seventh time, giving
                            him
                            his 17th WGC title and first since 2009.[96] Two weeks later, he won the Arnold Palmer
                            Invitational, winning the event for a record-tying 8th time. The win moved him back to the
                            top
                            of the world rankings.[97] To commemorate that achievement, Nike was quick to launch an ad
                            with
                            the tagline "winning takes care of everything".[98]

                            During the 2013 Masters, Woods faced disqualification after unwittingly admitting in a
                            post-round interview with ESPN that he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole when his
                            third shot bounced off the pin and into the water. After further review of television
                            footage,
                            Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop but was not disqualified.[99] He
                            finished
                            tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second
                            career
                            win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he got to
                            four
                            wins in any season of his professional career.</p>

                        <p>Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S. Open as a result of an elbow injury that he
                            sustained
                            at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score as a
                            professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break
                            because
                            of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT&T National, he
                            returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and
                            beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed
                            of
                            the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five
                            strokes
                            behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the
                            WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event
                            in
                            its 15-year history. His second-round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could
                            easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes.
                            This
                            gave him a seven-stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. But at the
                            PGA
                            Championship at Oak Hill Country Club, Woods never was in contention, making 2013 his fifth
                            full
                            season where he did not win a major; he was in contention in only two of the four majors in
                            2013.</p>
                        <p>After a slow start to 2014, Woods sustained an injury during the final round of The Honda
                            Classic
                            and was unable to finish the tournament. He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back
                            pain.[100]
                            He subsequently competed in the WGC-Cadillac Championship but was visibly in pain during
                            much of
                            the last round. He was forced to skip the Arnold Palmer Invitational at the end of March
                            2014,[101] and after undergoing back surgery, he announced on April 1 that he would miss the
                            Masters for the first time since 1994.[102] Woods returned at the Quicken Loans National in
                            June, however he said that his expectations for the week were low. He struggled with nearly
                            every aspect of his game and missed the cut. He next played at The Open Championship,
                            contested
                            at Hoylake, where Woods had won eight years prior. Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first
                            round
                            to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and eventually finished 69th. Despite
                            his
                            back pain, he played at the 2014 PGA Championship where he failed to make the cut. On August
                            25,
                            2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he
                            won
                            eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with
                            Haney.
                            Woods said there was currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.</p>

                        <p>On February 5, 2015, Woods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open after another back
                            injury.[104] Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and
                            he
                            would take a break from golf until his back healed.[105] He returned for the Masters,
                            finishing
                            in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree
                            root.
                            He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist, but he adjusted it back into place and
                            finished the round.[106] Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open
                            Championship,
                            the first time Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing near the bottom of the
                            leaderboard both times.[107] He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on
                            August
                            2.[108] In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing
                            the
                            tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place.[109]
                            Woods
                            offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back
                            surgery,
                            saying it was "just my hip" but offering no specifics.</p>
                        <p>Woods had back surgery on September 16, 2015. In late March 2016, he announced that he would
                            miss
                            the Masters while he recovered from the surgery;[111] he had also missed the 2014 Masters
                            due to
                            a back problem.[112] "I'm absolutely making progress, and I'm really happy with how far I've
                            come," he explained in a statement. "But I still have no timetable to return to competitive
                            golf."[113] However, he did attend the Masters Champions Dinner on April 5, 2016.[114] For
                            the
                            first time in his career, he missed all four majors in one year due to problems with his
                            back.
                            In October 2016, he told Charlie Rose on PBS that he still wanted to break Jack Nicklaus's
                            record of 18 major titles.[115] Woods underwent back surgery in December 2016 and spent the
                            next
                            15 months off the Tour. He made his return to competitive golf in the Hero World
                            Challenge.Woods's back problems continued to hinder him in 2017. He missed the cut at the
                            Farmers Insurance Open in January and pulled out of a European Tour event in Dubai on
                            February
                            3. On March 31, Woods announced on his website that he would not be playing in the 2017
                            Masters
                            Tournament despite being cleared to play by his doctors. Woods said that although he was
                            happy
                            with his rehabilitation, he did not feel "tournament ready."[117][118] Woods subsequently
                            told
                            friends, "I'm done".[119] On April 20, Woods announced that he had undergone his fourth back
                            surgery since 2014 to alleviate back and leg pain. Recovery time required up to six months,
                            meaning that Woods would spend the rest of the year without playing any professional
                            golf.[120]
                            Woods returned to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He shot
                            rounds of
                            69–68–75–68 and finished tied for 9th place. His world ranking went from 1,199th to 668th,
                            which
                            was the biggest jump in the world rankings in his career.</p>
                        <p>On March 11, 2018, he finished one-shot back and tied for second at the Valspar Championship
                            in
                            Florida, his first top-five finish on the PGA Tour since 2013.[121] He then tied for sixth
                            with
                            a score of five under par at the 2018 Open Championship.[122] At the last major of the year,
                            the
                            2018 PGA Championship, Woods finished second, two shots behind the winner Brooks Koepka. It
                            was
                            his best result in a major since 2009 (second at the 2009 PGA Championship) and moved him up
                            to
                            26th in the world rankings. His final round of 64 was his best-ever final round in a
                            major.Woods
                            returned to the winner's circle for the 80th time in his PGA Tour career on September 23,
                            2018,
                            when he won the season-ending Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club for the second time
                            and
                            that tournament for the third time. He shot rounds of 65–68–65–71 to win by two strokes over
                            Billy Horschel.</p>
                        <p>On April 14, 2019, Woods won the Masters, which was his first major championship win in
                            eleven
                            years and his 15th major overall. He finished 13 under par to win by one stroke over Dustin
                            Johnson, Xander Schauffele and Brooks Koepka.[125] At age 43, he became the second oldest
                            golfer
                            ever to win the Masters, after Jack Nicklaus who was 46 when he triumphed in 1986.[126] In
                            August 2019, Woods announced via social media that he underwent knee surgery to repair minor
                            cartilage damage and that he had an arthroscopic procedure during the Tour Championship. In
                            his
                            statement, Woods also confirmed that he was walking and intends on traveling and playing in
                            Japan in October.Woods played in his first 2020 PGA Tour event at the Zozo Championship in
                            October 2019, which was the first-ever PGA Tour event played in Japan. Woods, who played a
                            highly publicized skins game earlier in the week at the same course as the Championship,
                            held at
                            least a share of the lead after every round of the rain-delayed tournament, giving him a
                            three
                            stroke victory over Hideki Matsuyama.[128] The win was Woods's 82nd on Tour, tying him with
                            Sam
                            Snead for the most victories all time on the PGA Tour.</p>
                        <p>On December 23, 2020, Woods had microdiscectomy surgery on his back for the fifth time.[131]
                            The
                            operation was to remove a pressurized disc fragment that was pinching his nerve and causing
                            him
                            pain during the PNC ChampionWoods returned to play in his first professional tournament
                            since
                            his 2021 motor vehicle crash at the 2022 Masters Tournament. He made the cut and finished in
                            47th place at 13-over par, 23 shots behind the winner Scottie Scheffler.ship.</p>

                        Woods as "the greatest closer in history".[171] He has the lowest career scoring average and the
                        largest career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.Woods's victory at the 2013 Players

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990)[1][2] is a Norwegian chess grandmaster who is
                        the reigning five-time World Chess Champion. He is also a three-time World Rapid Chess Champion
                        and five-time World Blitz Chess Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE world chess
                        rankings since 1 July 2011 and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated
                        player in the world. His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record
                        for the longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess.</p>
                    <p>A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament shortly
                        after he turned 13 and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At 15, he won the
                        Norwegian Chess Championship, and at 17 he finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He
                        surpassed a rating of 2800 at 18, the youngest at the time to do so. In 2010, at 19, he reached
                        No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings, the youngest person ever to do so.</p>
                    <p>Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title
                        against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz
                        Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he
                        repeated in 2019. He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, against
                        Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and against Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen does not intend to
                        defend his title against Nepomniachtchi in 2023.</p>
                    <p>Known for his attacking style as a teen, Carlsen has since developed into a universal player. He
                        uses a variety of openings to make it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reduce the
                        utility of pre-game computer analysis. He has stated the middlegame is his favourite part of the
                        game as it "comes down to pure chess".</p>

                        <p>Carlsen received international fame and attention after becoming the winner of group C in the
                            Corus Chess Tournament in Wijk ann Zee. Another popular chess player, Grandmaster Lubomir
                            Kavalek gave him the title of “Mozart of Chess” after this phenomenal win.Magnus became a
                            Grandmaster at the age of 13 and had only been doing better throughout the years.</p>
                        <p>He received his second Grandmaster Norm at Moscow in 2004. Carlsen was knocked out of the
                            blitz chess tournament after drawing and then lost to Garry Kasparov.</p>
                        <p>Magnus got his third and final Grandmaster Norm at the Dubai Open Chess Championship. This
                            made him the second youngest Grandmaster in history at that time.Magnus was also the
                            youngest player to participate in FIDE World Chess Championship but was knocked out by Levon
                            Aronian.</p>
                        <p>2005 was a terrific year for Magnus Carlsen. He participated in many competitions like
                            Drammen International Chess Festival, Ciudad de León, Norwegian Chess Championship, Chess
                            World Cup etcetera, and succeeded in getting into the top 10 qualified to become a candidate
                            for the Official World Championship.Carlsen won his first Norwegian Chess Championship and
                            became the youngest person ever to do so. Later in 2006, we went on to win the big names in
                            Chess like Vishwanathan Anand, Alexander Morozevich, etc. and went on to win the Glitnir
                            Blitz Tournament in Iceland.</p>
                        <p>Carlsen played in the Linares Chess Tournament in 2007 and won against many top-rated players
                            like Vishwanathan Anand, Veselin Topalov, Peter Svidler, Levon Aronian, Peter Leko, and
                            Vassily Ivanchuk. He did extremely well and came second in the competition.Magnus Carlsen
                            participated in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament in Monte Carlo in 2007. He
                            came ninth in the blindfold match and second in the rapid matches. He made it into the
                            eighth position overall.</p>
                        <p>Carlsen again won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a score of 6/10 and a PR of 2753.
                            Immediately after this tournament, Carlsen took part in the Arctic Chess Challenge in
                            Tromsø. One of the games that attracted a lot of attention was when he competed and won
                            against his own father, Henrik Carlsen.Magnus successfully reached the World Chess Cup’s
                            semi-final round when he defeated Micheal Adams and Ivan Cheparinov. He later lost to the
                            eventual title winner, Gata Kamsky.</p>
                        <p>Magnus Carlsen landed in the Top group A at the 69th Corus Chess Tournament and shared with
                            Levon Aronian. He participated for the second time in the Melody Amber blind and Rapid Chess
                            tournament in Nice, France. He placed second in the overall competition.Carlsen qualified
                            for the FIDE Grand Prix 2008-09, a qualifier for World Chess Championship 2012.</p>
                        <p>He dropped from the championship despite doing extremely well initially and claimed the
                            reasons to be that FIDE dramatically changed the rules in the middle of a world championship
                            cycle.Carlsen participated in the 75th Tata Steel Chess Tournament and placed first with
                            Aronian closely following.</p>
                        <p>He also participated in the 2013 Candidates tournament in London. He won the tournament too.
                            This gave him the right to challenge Anand for the Chess Championship.</p>
                        <ul style="font-family: Poppins;">
                            <li>In 2004, he gained international attention after his victory in the C group at the Corus
                                chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee. Carlsen was just a young teenager and his victory in
                                the C group led Grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek to give him the title "Mozart of chess".
                            </li>
                            <li>In March 2004, he defeated former world champion Anatoly Karpov at a blitz chess
                                tournament, and went on to achieve one draw against Garry Kasparov, who was then the
                                top-rated player in the world. Carlsen was then defeated by Kasparov in another round
                                and thus knocked out of the tournament.</li>
                            <li>He finished at second place at the Dubai Open Chess Championship in April 2004 and
                                became a Grandmaster. At the time, he was the world's youngest Grandmaster, and the
                                third youngest person ever to hold GM status.</li>
                            <li>He played brilliantly at the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship but lost to Berge
                                Østenstad at the last-round. However, he was able to win the title for the first time in
                                the play-off.</li>
                            <li>He faced several formidable opponents in the prestigious Linares chess tournament in
                                2007, which many consider to be the "the Wimbledon of chess". Carlsen played against
                                top-rated players like Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, Peter Svidler, Alexander
                                Morozevich, and Levon Aronian, and achieved a second place.</li>
                            <li>He became the youngest person ever to win a category 18 tournament in August 2007 when
                                he won the International Chess Festival Biel Grandmaster Tournament. The next year he
                                shared first place with Levon Aronian in the Corus chess tournament, becoming the
                                youngest person ever to win a category 20 tournament.</li>
                            <li>In 2009, he won the World Blitz Championship in Moscow and then entered the London Chess
                                Classic as the top seed. He proceeded to defeat former world champion Vladimir Kramnik
                                and went on to win the tournament. In January 2010, FIDE announced that Carlsen was the
                                top player in the world.</li>
                            <li>In 2013, Magnus Carlsen faced world chess champion Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess
                                Championship in Chennai, India. Carlsen won the championship 6½–3½ by winning games
                                five, six and nine and drawing the remainder. Thus he became the new world chess
                                champion, the second youngest player (after Kasparov) to win the world title. He again
                                faced Anand in a match for the title of World Chess Champion in November 2014 and
                                successfully defended his World Champion title.</li>

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was an American chess grandmaster and the
                        eleventh World Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, he won his first of a record eight US
                        Championships at
                        the age of 14. In 1964, he won with an 11–0 score, the only perfect score in the history of the
                        tournament. Qualifying for the 1972 World Championship, Fischer swept matches with Mark Taimanov
                        and
                        Bent Larsen by 6–0 scores. After another qualifying match against Tigran Petrosian, Fischer won
                        the
                        title match against Boris Spassky of the USSR, in Reykjavík, Iceland. Publicized as a Cold War
                        confrontation between the US and USSR, the match attracted more worldwide interest than any
                        chess
                        championship before or since.</p>
                    <p>In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE,
                        chess's
                        international governing body, over the match conditions. Consequently, the Soviet challenger
                        Anatoly
                        Karpov was named World Champion by default. Fischer subsequently disappeared from the public
                        eye, though
                        occasional reports of erratic behavior emerged. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial
                        rematch
                        against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the
                        time. His
                        participation led to a conflict with the US government, which warned Fischer that his
                        participation in
                        the match would violate an executive order imposing US sanctions on Yugoslavia. The US
                        government
                        ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, Fischer lived as an émigré. In 2004, he
                        was
                        arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that the US government had
                        revoked.
                        Eventually, he was granted Icelandic citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic parliament,
                        allowing
                        him to live there until his death in 2008.</p>
                    <p>Fischer made numerous lasting contributions to chess. His book My 60 Memorable Games, published
                        in 1969,
                        is regarded as essential reading in chess literature. In the 1990s, he patented a modified chess
                        timing
                        system that added a time increment after each move, now a standard practice in top tournament
                        and match
                        play. He also invented Fischer random chess, also known as Chess960, a chess variant in which
                        the
                        initial position of the pieces is randomized to one of 960 possible positions.</p>
                    <p>Fischer made numerous antisemitic statements and denied the Holocaust; his antisemitism,
                        professed since
                        at least the 1960s, was a major theme in his public and private remarks. There has been
                        widespread
                        comment and speculation concerning his psychological condition based on his extreme views and
                        eccentric
                        behavior.</p>

                    <p>At 14 years of age he became the first North-American “adult” champion, a feat that was repeated
                        8 more
                        times (he won all national championships that he played)! At 15, he became the youngest
                        Grandmaster
                        until then, when he qualified to the Candidates Tournament for the first time.In his first
                        appearance in
                        the Candidates Tournament (Belgrade, 1959), the spot to challenge the world champion was taken
                        by
                        Mikhail Tal.</p>
                    <p>The second time he played the Candidates Tournament was in 1962 in Curacao, and the challenger
                        spot was
                        taken by Tigran Petrosian. In that occasion, Fischer accused his Russian opponents of fixing the
                        results
                        of the games that they played among themselves so that one of them would be in advantage in the
                        last
                        round. The famous episode has never been proved, but the World Chess Federation changed the
                        tournament
                        format and adopted the “knockout system”, avoiding suspicious draws since then.</p>
                    <p>In spite of that, the episode made Bobby Fischer announce that he would not play the Candidates
                        Tournament anymore. He only went back on his decision in the year of 1971, when he beat both
                        Mark
                        Taimanov and Bent Larsen by 6 – 0. The right to challenge the world champion came when he
                        defeated
                        Tigran Petrosian by 6.5 – 2.5.</p>

                        <p>By doing so, North-American Bobby Fischer would play Russian Boris Spassky for the world
                            title of
                            chess
                            in what was considered “the match of the century”.The importance given to that match was
                            greatly
                            due to
                            the fact that it just got beyond the chessboards, and just like in the space race, it became
                            a
                            true
                            battle field between capitalists and socialists right in the middle of Cold War.</p>
                        <p>And it all came about because the hegemony of the old Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
                            (USSR)
                            in chess
                            was overwhelming by then. Since when Mikhail Botvinnik, the Patriarch, clinched the world
                            title
                            in 1948,
                            the Soviets would take turns holding the crown: Smyslov in 1957, Botvinnik again in 1958,
                            Tal in
                            1960,
                            Botvinnik once again in 1961, Petrosian in 1963 and finally Spassky in 1969.In contrast, the
                            westerners
                            had the one who was already considered the best player of all time. However, Boris Spassky
                            was
                            then the
                            only opponent that Fischer had never defeated.</p>
                        <p>The famous match of 1972 began way before the first move, when Bobby Fischer started to
                            impose
                            countless
                            demands, which ranged from the place where the games would be held, went through
                            postponements,
                            and got
                            to the issue of his participation purse, until he was finally sponsored by a British banker
                            who
                            was a
                            lover of the 64 squares.</p>
                        <p>Fischer’s eccentricities had been long known. In the 1959 North-American Championship he
                            refused
                            to play
                            unless the match draws were conducted in his presence. He pulled back from oddities and
                            became
                            champion.
                            However, in the 1967 Interzonal Tournament held in Sousse, Tunisia, despite holding the
                            lead, he
                            withdrew from the contest claiming religious issues. He refused to play between Friday at
                            dusk
                            and
                            Saturday also at dusk. As the organizers did not object to it, though, Fischer did not
                            accept to
                            play 4
                            games on 4 straight days to compensate for the consequent delays.</p>
                        <p>During the contention for the 1972 title, Fischer kept on making his demands based on the
                            persecution
                            complex that made him believe he had been constantly harmed by the Soviets. He complained
                            about
                            the
                            chair, the audience and the cameras. So, he had all of his demands met even with Spassky’s
                            consent.
                            According to some, that fact rattled the Soviet a little, and he performed below his usual.
                        </p>
                        <p>Spassky won games 1 and 11. He also won game 2 by WO once the American opponent did not show
                            up
                            to play.
                            Fischer won games 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 21, and on September 1, 1972 he became a chess
                            world
                            champion.Many consider Fischer’s victory in game 6 as the best in the match. To me, however,
                            the
                            best
                            game ended in a draw, with both players performing at the best of their skills.</p>

                    <p>Bobby Fischer became the World Chess Champion after defeating Soviet Boris Spassky in 1972 — then
                        he
                        descended into madness.In 1972, the U.S. seemed to have found an unlikely weapon in its Cold War
                        struggle against Soviet Russia: a teen chess champion named Bobby Fischer. Though he would be
                        celebrated
                        for decades to come as a chess champ, Bobby Fischer later died in relative obscurity following a
                        descent
                        into mental instability</p>
                    <p>But in 1972, he was at the center of the world stage. The U.S.S.R. had dominated the Chess World
                        Championship since 1948. It saw its unbroken record as proof of the Soviet Union’s intellectual
                        superiority over the West. But in 1972, Fischer would unseat the USSR’s greatest chess master,
                        reigning
                        world chess champion Boris Spassky.</p>
                    <p>Some say there has never been a chess player as great as Bobby Fischer. To this day, his games
                        are
                        scrutinized and studied. He has been likened to a computer with no noticeable weaknesses, or, as
                        one
                        Russian grandmaster described him, as “an Achilles without an Achilles heel.”</p>
                    <p>Despite his legendary status in the annals of chess history, Fischer expressed an erratic and
                        disturbing
                        inner life. It seemed as if Bobby Fischer’s mind was every bit as fragile as it was
                        brilliant.The world
                        would watch as its greatest chess genius played out every paranoid delusion in his mind.</p>

                        Efren Manalang Reyes OLD PLH (born August 26, 1954), popularly known
                        by the nickname "Bata" (English: "Kid"), is a Filipino professional
                        pool player. Known as the Greatest Pool player of all time. A winner
                        of over 100 international titles, Reyes was the first player to win
                        the WPA World Championships in two different pool disciplines. Among
                        his numerous titles, Reyes is a WPA World Nine-ball champion and WPA
                        World Eight-ball Champion, a U.S. Open winner, a two-time World Pool
                        League winner, and a thirteen-time Derby City Classic winner. Reyes
                        also represented the Philippines at the World Cup of Pool, winning the
                        event with his partner Francisco Bustamante in 2006 and 2009. By
                        defeating American player Earl Strickland in the inaugural Color of
                        Money event in 1996, Reyes took home the largest single match purse in
                        pool history of Top 10 Best Pool Players of All Time.

                    <p>
                        Reyes is nicknamed "The Magician"—for his ability on the pool
                        table—and "Bata", to distinguish from a fellow pool player by the same
                        name. In addition to pool, Reyes has played international billiards,
                        specifically one-cushion and three-cushion.

                        <p>
                            In 1978, Reyes competed in the Philippines vs. Japan Pocket Billiards
                            Competition, where Reyes represented the Philippines alongside Jose
                            Parica, Rodolfo Luat, Jorge Dacer and Manuel Flores, where the
                            Philippines team won two years in a row until the event ended. in
                            1979, Reyes defeated Japanese champion Takeshi Okumura to win the All
                            Japan Championship in 9-ball, although not winning the all around
                            title that year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1983, Reyes took on Pepito Dacer in the finals of the Philippine
                            Professional Pocket Billiards Championships, which was played in
                            rotation. The finals were played in race-to-39 and the players
                            competed over 11 racks on a weekly basis. On the seventh week of play,
                            Reyes defeated Dacer 39–32.[5] During the 1980s, when Reyes was
                            considered a top-class player in his homeland but not yet
                            internationally recognized, he went to the United States to hustle in
                            1984. Reyes claims to have earned $80,000 in a few weeks, which made
                            him a folk hero back in the Philippines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reyes began winning a number of tournaments in the United States,
                            Europe and parts of Asia, garnering attention and recognition
                            worldwide. At the start of his career, he used aliases such as "Cesar
                            Morales" to hide his identity so he would be allowed to compete.[7]
                            Reyes became internationally known at the U.S. Open 9-Ball
                            Championship in 1994. Having finished third in 1985,[8] he defeated
                            Nick Varner in the finals and became the first non-American to win the
                            event.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two years later, Reyes and Earl Strickland were chosen to compete in
                            an event, named after the recently released film The Color of
                            Money.[11] The event was a three-day race-to-120 challenge match of
                            nine-ball.[12] It was held in Hong Kong, with a winner-take-all prize
                            of $100,000.[12] Reyes won the match 120–117 despite being 17 racks
                            behind, to win the all-time largest purse in any professional pool
                            event.[12] In 1999, Reyes won the first televised World Professional
                            Pool Championship. At the time, the tournament was not recognized by
                            the World Pool Association, which ran their own event, although they
                            later acknowledged the event was an official world
                            championship.[13][14] In 2001, Reyes participated in the 2001 Tokyo
                            Open, with over 700 participants and a total purse of ¥100 million
                            ($850K). Reyes dominated the event, beating Niels Feijen in the finals
                            15–7 and earning ¥20M ($163k) first prize. At the time, this was the
                            biggest first prize in a pool tournament.

                        <p>
                            Reyes won the 2002 International Challenge of Champions, defeating
                            Mika Immonen in a deciding rack.[16] He reached the final of the 2004
                            WPA World Eight-ball Championship, where he met Marlon Manalo in the
                            final.[17][18] He trailed 0–4, but won eight straight racks and won
                            the final 11–8.[19] The win made Reyes the first player to win WPA
                            world championships in more than one discipline.Reyes won the 2005 IPT
                            King of the Hill Eight-ball Shootout, which offered the highest top
                            prize of any pool event to that date – $200K.[20] In the final, he met
                            Mike Sigel in a best-of-three sets match, winning 8–0 in the first set
                            and 8–5 in the second.[21] The following year, Reyes won the IPT World
                            Open Eight-ball Championship over Rodney Morris 8–6, earning $500K—a
                            larger sum than that he earned at the King of the Hill event.

                        <p>
                            He partnered with Francisco Bustamante to represent the Philippines at
                            the inaugural World Cup of Pool. They reached the 2006 final, where
                            they met Earl Strickland and Rodney Morris representing the United
                            States.[23] They won seven consecutive racks to win the final
                            13–5.[24] He also won the 2009 event once again partnering
                            Bustamante.[25] The pair met the German team of Ralf Souquet and
                            Thorsten Hohmann in the final and won 11–9.As of 2019, Reyes is still
                            actively competing in professional pool.[29] Overall, he is the most
                            successful player at the Derby City Classic, having won the overall
                            championship on five occasions, and winning the event on fourteen
                            occasions.[30] He has also won two gold medals and six bronze medals
                            at the Southeast Asian Games including an eight-ball bronze medal at
                            the 2002 Asian Games.

                            he had to be satisfied as runner-up after losing to Chou Tien-chen
                            with a score of 18–21, 26–24, 15–21.[16] Antonsen captured the

                            lost to the first seeded, the reigning champion Kento Momota in
                            straight games 9–21, 3–21.[17] Antonsen won the end of the season
                            2020 BWF World Tour Finals beating Viktor Axelsen in the finals.[18]
                            In 2021, Antonsen participated at the European Mixed Team
                            Championships in Finland, and helped the team win the gold
                            medal.[19] At the May European Championships, he was crowned as the
                            men's singles champion, after organizers decided to cancel the
                            finals, due to his opponent, Viktor Axelsen, tested positive for
                            COVID-19.

                            Starting off the season in 2022, Antonsen managed to avenge his loss
                            to Loh Kean Yew in the World Championships semi finals, winning
                            against the reigning world champion in the first round of the All
                            England Open, in rubber games, 21–15, 18–21, 21–13.[22] He then lost
                            in the next round to Lakshya Sen, in straight games, 16–21,
                            18–21.[23] On 30 April, Antonsen won silver at the European
                            Championships losing to compatriot Viktor Axelsen (17–21, 15–21) in
                            the finals in Madrid, Spain.[24] Antonsen was very upset over the
                            quality of his own play, saying audiences nearly deserved an
                            apology.

                        <p>
                            Antonsen then pulled out of the Asian leg of tournaments, the
                            Indonesia Masters, the Indonesia Open, the Malaysian Open, the
                            Malaysian Masters and the Singapore Open, citing injuries.

                            Ranked first as of March 2021, Momota has been into badminton since
                            early childhood. Kento began his badminton training in grade first
                            in elementary school.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Momota grabbed a fairly prestigious title in Japan’s tournament, the
                            All Japan Elementary School Championships, when he was in the sixth
                            grade. If Momota hadn’t won the title, he would have opted for
                            baseball. However, after winning, he realized his badminton talent
                            and decided to go with it. Although Momota’s badminton career began
                            at his junior high level, he gained popularity in badminton only
                            after competing in a bigger race, the 2011 World Junior
                            Championship, held in Taiwan. Kento bore a defeat in the semifinal
                            round against Malaysian Zulfadli Zulkiffli and still won a bronze
                            medal. Later, at the end of 2011, in the same tournament in Japan,
                            Kento Momota lost the finals game. He was defeated by the All Japan
                            Badminton Championship champion, Kenichi Tago. However, his talent
                            was appreciated by the Nippon Badminton Association (NBA).
                            Afterward, Kento joined the Japanese national team and started
                            playing for the national team in various championships. Since then,
                            young Momota has been shining brightly in his Career and, up until
                            now, is the world’s top-ranked badminton player in men’s singles
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even though Kento was brought to the knees in the semifinal round by
                            the 2011 Championship, he did not stop learning from his defeats.
                            Instead, young and talented Momota continued to push himself. And
                            finally, he overcame the defeat from 2011 by winning the 2012 Asia
                            Junior Championship. The championship was held in South Korea. And
                            in two straight games with 21-13, 22-20 points, he won against the
                            Malaysian representative, Soong Joo Ven. Later that same year, Kento
                            grabbed the World Junior Championship after defeating the Chinese
                            representative, Xue Song. He also won the gold medal for his home
                            country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2013, Kento Momota officially joined the badminton club of NTT
                            (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation). After that, he
                            started participating in youth competitions and emerged in various
                            superseries throughout 2013.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2014, Kento won Thomas Cup and seized the Singapore Open a year
                            later. After winning the title, he became the first Japanese player
                            to capture a Super Series in a men’s single. Similarly, Momota
                            created history in the Badminton World Federation (BWF) Championship
                            held in Jakarta by winning a medal in the Men’s Singles category.
                            despite losing the semi final game against chen long,kento become
                            the first japenese player to win a medal in the prestigious
                            tournament.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Likewise, in the same year, Momota won the 2015 BWF World
                            Superseries Final in Dubai. The following year, he competed in Asia
                            Team Championship, held in Hyderabad. Unfortunately, the year 2016
                            was not fruitful for Kento. He was banned for almost a year by
                            Nippon Badminton Association (NBA) four months before the Rio
                            Olympics. The NBA suspended Momota after he confessed to a gambling
                            scandal where he visited an illegal casino.

                        Michael Fred Phelps II[5] (born June 30, 1985)[6] is an American
                        former competitive swimmer. He is the most successful and most
                        decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps
                        also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9]
                        Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in
                        individual events (16).[10] When Phelps won eight gold medals at the
                        2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972
                        record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At
                        the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps already tied the record of
                        eight medals of any color at a single Games by winning six gold and
                        two bronze medals. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won
                        four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in
                        Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him
                        the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a
                        row.

                        Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's
                        international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him
                        the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer
                        of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the
                        Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned Sports Illustrated

                        promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012
                        Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer

                            Born in Baltimore, Michael was the youngest of three children. He
                            began swimming at the age of 7. By the time he reached 10 he had
                            already held a national record for swimmers of his age in the 100
                            meter butterfly event. In 2000 he became the youngest male to join the
                            US Olympic swimming team in 68 years. At his first games in Sydney,
                            Phelps finished fifth in the 200m butterfly event. In the following
                            years Phelps dominated the swimming world. He competed in 6 single
                            events, including butterfly, freestyle and backstroke as well as the
                            medley races. Phelps not only became the world's best swimmer, but
                            also inspired other Americans . At the Rio games, the United States
                            was the world's most successful swimming nation.

                            Although rival Ryan Lochte and other swimmers predict that Phelps
                            might be back for the 2020 games in Tokyo, the swimming superstar
                            stated that this was his last goodbye. Now, Michael Phelps wants to
                            spend more time working with his foundation, which he created after
                            the Beijing Olympics to make swimming more popular among young people.
                            He also wants more time with his family.

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Usain St. Leo Bolt, OJ, CD, OLY (/ˈjuːseɪn/;[12] born 21 August 1986) is a retired Jamaican
                        sprinter, widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time.[13][14][15] He is the world
                        record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay.</p>
                    <p>An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m
                        titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, and 2016). He also won two 4 × 100 relay gold
                        medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008
                        Beijing Olympics, which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic
                        time became mandatory.</p>
                    <p>An eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship 100 m, 200 m and 4 × 100
                        metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011.
                        He is the most successful male athlete of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to
                        win four World Championship titles in the 200 m and is one of the most successful in the 100 m
                        with three titles.</p>
                    <p>Bolt improved upon his second 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest
                        improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the 200 metres world
                        record, setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three 4 × 100 metres
                        relay world records, with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most
                        successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was
                        his international debut over 100 m; he had earlier won numerous 200 m medals (including 2007
                        World Championship silver) and held the world under-20 and world under-18 records for the event
                        until being surpassed by Erriyon Knighton in 2021.</p>
                    <p>His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname "Lightning Bolt", and his
                        awards include the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track & Field Athlete of the Year, BBC
                        Overseas Sports Personality of the Year (three times), and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year
                        (four times). Bolt was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2016.[16] Bolt
                        retired after the 2017 World Championships, when he finished third in his last solo 100 m race,
                        opted out of the 200 m, and pulled up injured in the 4×100 m relay final.</p>

                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">At the 2008 Olympic Games, Bolt became the first man since American Carl
                            Lewis in 1984 to win the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100-metre relay in a single
                            Olympics and the first ever to set world records (9.69 sec, 19.30 sec, and 37.10
                            sec,respectively) in all three events. (However, a failed drug test by one of his 4 × 100
                            teammates led to Bolt’s having his gold medal in that event stripped.) His 0.66-sec winning
                            margin in the 200-metre race was the largest in Olympic history, and his 0.20-sec edge over
                            the second-place finisher in the 100 metres, despite beginning his victory celebration about
                            80 metres into the race, was the largest since Lewis won by the same margin. At the 2009
                            world championships, Bolt shattered his 100-metre record, winning the event final in 9.58
                            sec. Four days later he broke his own 200-metre record by the same 0.11-sec margin to win a
                            second gold medal at the world championships</p>
                        <p>Bolt was the heavy favourite in the sprint events heading into the 2011 world championships,
                            but a false start disqualified him from the 100-metre final. Despite failing to medal in his
                            signature race, Bolt recovered to capture golds in the 200 metres and the 4 × 100-metre
                            relay, helping to set a new world record in the latter event. At the 2012 Olympics in
                            London, Bolt defended his titles in the 100-metre and 200-metre events (setting an Olympic
                            record in the former) to become the first person to win both races in consecutive Olympiads.
                            In 2013 he won three gold medals at the world championships (100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 ×
                            100-metre relay).</p>
                        <img style="float: right;" src="../IMAGES/boltcareer.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p>At the 2015 world championships Bolt again won gold medals in his three signature events (100
                            metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100-metre relay), and his fourth career 200-metre gold extended
                            his record for most wins in that race at the world championships. He cemented his role as
                            the best sprinter in history at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, where he captured
                            golds in the 100-metre, 200-metre, and 4 × 100-metre relay events, becoming the first person
                            to win golds in the two individual sprints in three straight Olympics. He retired from
                            athletics after the 2017 world championships, where he won a bronze medal in the 100-metre
                            sprint and finished in eighth place as a member of the 4 × 100-metre relay team after
                            injuring a hamstring during the final.</p>

                        <p>Bolt published a memoir, My Story: 9:58: The World’s Fastest Man (written with Shaun Custis),
                            in 2010. It was expanded and reissued as The Fastest Man Alive: The True Story of Usain Bolt

                        <p> Bolt's personal best of 9.58 seconds in 2009 in the 100 metres is the fastest ever run.[339]
                            Bolt also holds the second fastest time of 9.63 seconds,[87] the current Olympic record,[89]
                            and set two previous world records in the event. Bolt's personal best of 19.19 s in the 200
                            metres is the world record. This was recorded at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics
                            in Berlin against a headwind of −0.3 m/s (−1.1 km/h; −0.67 mph). This performance broke his
                            previous world record in the event, his 19.30 s clocking in winning the 2008 Olympic 200
                            metres title</p>
                        <p>Bolt has been on three world-record-setting Jamaican relay teams. The first record, 37.10
                            seconds, was set in winning gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics, although the result was voided
                            in 2017 when the team was disqualified. The second record came at the 2011 World
                            Championships in Athletics, a time of 37.04 seconds. The third world record was set at the
                            2012 Summer Olympics, a time of 36.84 seconds.[340]</p>

                    <p>Sohail Abbas, (born 9 June 1977) is a former professional field hockey player from Pakistan who
                        played as a Full-back. Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time he is the highest
                        goal scorer in international field hockey with 348 international goals.[1] A drag-flick
                        specialist noted for his lethal flicks with great accuracy and speed in front of goal from
                        penalty corners he is widely regarded as the 'King of the drag flick'.</p>
                    <p>Abbas started his professional career in Pakistan and played professional hockey in Malaysia,
                        Netherlands, Germany and India in his career most notably for Dutch side HC Rotterdam. After
                        representing Pakistan at junior levels Abbas made his international debut in the Test series
                        against India in February 1998. He scored his first senior international goal in the second
                        match of the series in a 2–1 win. Abbas has 315 caps for Pakistan and in which he scored 348
                        goals including 21 hat-tricks an international record. He has represented his country at 1998,

                    <div class="para-container pt-3">
                        <img src="../IMAGES/sohailcareer.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">When he made his international debut during the 20th Pakistan-India series
                            1998, his role was only to come from the bench for penalty corner drills. His debut was at
                            Peshawar's Lala S.M. Ayub Hockey Stadium on Saturday, 28 February 1998. Pakistan manager
                            effected a substitution midway through the tie, but failed to make an impact. He failed to
                            score in three penalty corners as Pakistan won 4–1. The following day, on 1 March 1998, in
                            the second test at Rawalpindi's Army Hockey Stadium, Abbas announced his arrival on the
                            international scene in dramatic fashion, scoring a drag flick from a penalty corner which
                            proved to be the match-winner in Pakistan's 2–1 victory.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">When the rule was changed after the 1998 World Cup, he was not considered for
                            the 1998 Commonwealth Games by coach Shahnaz Sheikh. But he staged a comeback to win silver
                            in 1998 Hockey Champions Trophy in Lahore and bronze at the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games. Abbas
                            struck 20 goals in 1998.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">In 1999 Abbas was in terrific form. He started off the year being the top scorer
                            in both the 1999 India-Pakistan test series with 10 goals and 1999 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup
                            with 12 goals helping Pakistan win the title for the first time.[11] He finished top scorer
                            of the 1999 Hockey Asia Cup with 16 goals equaling the record of Hasan Sardar of most goals
                            in an edition of the tournament in 1982.[12] During the match against Sri Lanka he scored 7
                            goals in the 15–0 victory making him only the sixth player to have scored a double-hattrick
                            for Pakistan in a match. But Pakistan finished second after losing the final to South Korea.
                            Abbas finished the year with 60 goals breaking the record of most international goals in a
                            calendar year by Paul Litjens of Netherlands, 58.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Pakistan qualified for Sydney Olympics by taking part in 2000 Olympic Qualifiers
                            in March 2000 in Osaka. Pakistan finished second on the Japanese soil, with Sohail scoring
                            13 goals to finish as leading marksman. Abbas was also leading scorer at the 2000 Olympic
                            Games, Sydney, with 11 goals. Mixing his impressive hitting abilities with drag-flicks,
                            Abbas has proved himself to be the world's most consistent drag-flick converter, his success
                            rate over 65% mark. Pakistan lost the bronze medal match to hosts Australia by 6-3 finishing
                            fourth. This as of now was the last time Pakistan played for a medal at the Olympics in
                            hockey. His total goals in 2000 were 26.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Abbas scored a total of 37 goals in the 2001. Pakistan started off the year
                            playing in an invitational tournament in Dhaka, Bangladesh where they finished second after
                            losing the final to India on penalty strokes. During the tour of Europe he scored a
                            hat-trick against South Korea in Hamburg, Germany. Later he was top-scorer of the 2001
                            Sultan Azlan Shah Cup with 10 goals but Pakistan finished fourth. In the last assignment of
                            the year Pakistan played in the Champions Trophy in Rotterdam where he scored another
                            hat-trick against Germany but Pakistan again finished at fourth place</p>
                        <p class="px-2">Sohail attracted worldwide attention in 2002 when he emerged as the joint
                            highest scorer along with Argentina's Jorge Lombi in the 10th World Cup at Kuala Lumpur. And
                            all 10 goals that Abbas scored at the Bukit Jalil Stadium in the Malaysian capital were off
                            PCs. He managed 44 goals in 2002 and added yet another feather to his cap in that year.
                            Hasan Sardar was Pakistan's top scorer with 150 goals before Abbas unveiled his goal-scoring
                            prowess. During the Six-Nation Invitational tournament at Kuala Lumpur, a month before World
                            Cup 2002, Sohail scored his 151st international goal, becoming Pakistan's all-time highest
                            scorer in international hockey. He struck nine goals as Pakistan managed bronze medals in
                            17th Commonwealth Games hockey tournament at Manchester. He struck hat-trick when Pakistan
                            routed South Africa 10–2 in bronze-decider on 4 August 2002. Later, in the 24th CT in
                            Cologne, Germany, Sohail played a major role and Pakistan finished third ahead of India.</p>
                        <img style="float: right;" src="../IMAGES/sohailcareer2.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2">Sohail started 2004 in whirlwind fashion and won the top scorer award in
                            13th Azlan Shah Cup at Bukit Jalil Complex. He struck ten goals with the help of two hat
                            tricks against India and Germany. He managed one double hat trick and 21 hat tricks in
                            international hockey so far: a record unmatched in international field hockey. Sohail
                            recorded 59 goals in 2004 and was well poised to break his own world record of most goals in
                            calendar year (60 in 1999) before retirement. Sohail was the key figure when Pakistan won a
                            place at the 2004 Summer Olympics by finishing third at the 2004 Olympic Qualifiers in
                            Madrid on 13 March 2004. Three times Olympic Champion Pakistan also qualified Sohail was
                            also leading marksman at Madrid with nine goals. Four of these nine goals were against India
                            in league encounter when he converted four out of four penalty corners. At Athens, he became
                            the record Pakistani goalscorer in a single Olympiad, beating the 10-goal record of
                            centre-forward Hassan Sardar, created at the Los Angeles Olympiad twenty years beforehand.
                            Only Sohail, Sardar and Abdul Rashid Jr. have topped the goal scoring-chart in Olympics
                            hockey.</p>
                        <p class="px-2">After retiring form the national team he missed all of the 2005 campaigns even
                            the 2006 World Cup qualification in China but he was recalled for the tour of Europe and the
                            2006 Champions Trophy before the World Cup. Pakistan finished a disappointing sixth at the
                            2006 World Cup in Germany.</p>
                        <p class="px-">After remaining out of national setup for two years and missing the 2008 Beijing
                            Olympics Abbas was called back into the national squad for the 2009 Hockey Asia Cup where
                            Pakistan lost the final to South Korea. Abbas helped secure qualification for the 2010 World
                            Cup by winning the qualifiers in Lille, France, and later finished silver in the Hockey
                            Champions Challenge I in Argentina. Despite good performances in the test series with
                            Netherlands in previous months Pakistan finished their worst 12th at the 2010 World Cup in
                            New Delhi managing to win just a match. Abbas first Major Gold Medal was in 2010 Asian Games
                            held in China. Abbas's finest moment for Pakistan continued to be the 2010 Asian Games as he
                            was part of the team which beat South Korea 4–3 on penalty strokes. Abbas however missed his
                            penalty. Malaysia defeated India 4–3 and played Pakistan in the final. On 25 November 2010
                            the Malaysia v Pakistan final started during the 28th minute of the match Abbas scored a
                            penalty corner to give Pakistan a 1–0 lead. Rehan Butt scored a goal 4 minutes after half
                            time to extend the lead to 2–0. Malaysia failed to score and the whistle blew with Pakistan
                            winning the 2010 Asian Games Hockey Tournament. This became Pakistan's first victory at the
                            Asian Games since 1990 and their first victory in a major international tournament since the
                            1994 Champions Trophy. The 16-year drought ended and Pakistan and Sohail Abbas put a poor
                            World Cup and Commonwealth Games behind them to give their country their first major trophy
                            in 16 years.</p>
                        <img src="../IMAGES/sohailcareer3.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                        <p class="px-2 pt-2 pb-4">Abbas remained part of the team setup with the Olympics in mind. In
                            2011 he scored 19 goals for Pakistan. After serving Pakistan for almost 14 years, Abbas was
                            awarded the captaincy of the national hockey side for the first time in the Azlan Shah Cup
                            and London Olympics 2012.[19] Abbas's side ended 7th (last) in the Azlan Shah 2012
                            tournament. Similarly, they ended the Olympics at the 7th position despite starting off with
                            a draw against Spain. Sohail was dropped from the team after the Olympics. Later he
                            announced his retirement from the national side.</p>
