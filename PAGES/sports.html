                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Football</span> also called association football or soccer,
                        game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and
                        arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted
                        to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team
                        that scores more goals wins.</p>
                    <p>Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple
                        in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from
                        official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or
                        beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association
                        (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million
                        football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined
                        television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the
                        quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">POSITIONS</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Goalkeeper-</span> The main aim of a goalkeeper is to stop the
                    opposing team from scoring a goal. The goalkeeper is restricted to the rectangular penalty area
                    which is 18 yards away from the goal and he is the only player in the game who is allowed to use his
                    hands to stop the ball.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Defenders-</span> The defenders are positioned in front of the
                    goalkeeper and their aim is to stop the opposing team from entering into their goal area.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outside Fullback-</span> They play on the left and right flanks and
                    see that the ball doesn’t pass over them. They rarely move from their positions.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Central Defenders-</span> They are positioned in the center of the
                    field and are supposed to cover the leading goal scorer of the opposition’s team.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Midfielders- </span> They are the link between the defenders and
                    attackers. They need to be fit and physically very strong than other players on the field as they
                    are the players who run maximum time of the game all around the field. Their responsibility is to
                    enter the opposing team’s area and see that they defend them when the opposing team retains the
                    ball. </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forwards- </span>Their main aim is to score goals or to create an
                    easy situation for their teammates to score a goal.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center Forward- </span>The most tactful, dangerous and strong player
                    of the game. They are also called strikers. Strikers are basically the leading goal scorers in the
                    game.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Field Of Play-</span>A field of play for soccer rules and
                    regulations needs to be rectangular in shape. A playing surface should have clear and continuous
                    marked boundary lines. <br>The field surface may be completely natural (e.g. grass) or it can be a
                    green colored artificial surface (e.g. AstroTurf).Even so, some hybrid systems actually combine
                    artificial and natural materials and still meet FIFA field of play regulation.The touchlines make up
                    the two longest boundary lines of the rectangle. Whereas, the goal lines will form the two shorter
                    boundary lines. The halfway line divides the field into two same-sized halves.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pitch Measurements-</span><br>
                <ul style=" font-family: Open Sans;">
                    <li>Standard touch line length should be a minimum of 90 metres and up to a maximum of 120 metres.
                    </li>
                    <li>Goal line width should be at least 45 metres wide, but no more than 90 metres in width.</li>
                    <li>The distance between the white goalposts is 7.32 metres (8 yards). The lower edge of the
                        crossbar should measure 2.44 metres to the ground (8 feet).</li>
                    <li>The goal must be in a central position on the goal line and there needs to be one goal located
                        at each end of the field.</li>
                    <li>There must be a flag post and a flag positioned as boundary markers at each corner of the pitch.
                        The four corner posts should be upright and at least 1.5 metres high (5 feet) - without a
                        pointed top.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Ball-</span>The international standard on football ball weight
                    and sizes comes from FIFA Law 2. Check the integrity required for all approved match balls used in
                    association football games.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Match Rules-</span><br>
                <ul style=" font-family: Open Sans;">
                    <li>The basic rules and regulations in football competitions allow two teams to play against each
                        other. The number of players in each team should not exceed eleven. One of the team members must
                        be a goalkeeper.</li>
                    <li>As a rule, the goalkeeper protects the goal area. The other soccer player positions include
                        defenders, midfield players, wingers, central midfield, and attackers.</li>
                    <li>Before any play begins, the match referee conducts a coin toss to determine which team will
                        choose the initial direction of play.</li>
                    <li>The maximum number of substitutes allowed in a match differs between competitions. Games played
                        in the English Premier League allow a manager to make up to three (3) changes per game. Even so,
                        the referee must have the names of all substitute players before the start of the match.</li>
                    <li>One of the players must take on the role of team captain. Despite having no special privileges,
                        the captain has some responsibility for the team's behaviour on the field.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Football Referee Rules and Regulations-</span><br>
                <ul style=" font-family: Open Sans;">
                    <li>Match referees regulate the 17 laws of football with complete authority. The football referee
                        rules the game while enforcing all the fundamentals.</li>
                    <li>The officials in football use yellow and red caution cards as signals for fouls and for any
                        unsporting behaviour.</li>
                    <li>Foul play and misconduct results in disciplinary action admonished by the referee.</li>
                    <li>Questioning a referee's decision may result in further discipline. The introduction of new FIFA
                        rules for dissent are tackling bad behaviour in the game. Nonetheless, the word of the referee
                        is law.</li>
                    <li>Soccer penalty kicks result from any direct free kick offence committed inside their team's
                        penalty area or off the field (as outlined in football laws 12 and 13).</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration of the Match-</span>A match is played over two separate
                    halves. Each half lasts for 45 minutes of normal playing time with a fifteen (15) minute interval at
                    half-time.The opposing team will restart the game with a kick-off taken at the center of the halfway
                    line if a team scores a goal. <br>Extra playing time is usually imposed at the referee's discretion
                    for time lost due to injuries and player substitutions. The referee can extend the half beyond 45
                    minutes if a player needs to take a penalty kick (or retake it). In most cases, an abandoned match
                    would be rescheduled and replayed at a later date.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting and Restarting Play-</span><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a team concedes a goal, they will restart normal play with a kick-off taken from the center
                        spot.</li>
                    <li>A throw-in is used to restart play after the ball completely crosses a boundary touchline.</li>
                    <li>Goal kicks restart play if the whole ball passes over the goal line outside the goalmouth after
                        touching an attacking player.</li>
                    <li>Corner kicks result when all of the ball crosses the goal line after making contact with a
                        player from the defending team (if not a goal).</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ball In and Out Play-</span><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>he ball is in play at all times unless the referee stops the game or for a short period
                        immediately after a team scores a goal.</li>
                    <li>
                        The ball is out of play when:
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type:disc;">It has wholly passed over the goal line or touchline on

                    football, the team which has scored the most goals once the game is over (e.g. after the final
                    whistle) will be declared as the winner. <br>But, if the scores are equal at the end of play then
                    the match is a draw. Some football competition rules allow extra time (30 minutes) or a penalty

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Off side Offences and Fouls-</span>The offside offence is a
                    technical rule infraction in association football. A different section clarifies how the football
                    offside rule ensures there are opponents between the attacking player receiving the ball and the
                    goal. <br>The referee will award a direct free kick if a player commits any of these types of
                    football fouls: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jumps at an opponent</li>
                    <li>Charges an opponent</li>
                    <li>Strikes or attempts to strike an opponent</li>
                    <li>Kicks or attempts to kick an opponent</li>
                    <li>Trips or attempts to trip an opponent</li>
                    <li>Pushes an opponent</li>
                    <li>Holds an opponent</li>
                    <li>Tackles an opponent</li>
                    <li>Spits at an opponent</li>
                    <li>Handles the ball deliberately</li>
                </ul>
                The direct free kick results in a penalty kick if the offence is committed by a player in their own
                penalty area. <br>An indirect free kick will be awarded if a player commits any of these fouls: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jumps at an opponent</li>
                    <li>Prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from his/her hands</li>
                    <li>Strikes an opponent</li>
                    <li>Impedes the progress of an opponent</li>
                    <li>Commits any other unmentioned offense</li>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY OF FOOTBALL</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Early Years-</span><br> Modern football originated in Britain in
                    the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and
                    villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization,
                    which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a
                    history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to
                    undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a
                    winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester,
                    Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and
                    others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to
                    continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and
                    codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public
                    schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge
                    graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan
                    London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the
                    carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football
                    Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited
                    by the FA. <br>The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained
                    their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the
                    home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield
                    Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played
                    two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex
                    against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an
                    invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the
                    associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the
                    London clubs’ initial dominance had diminished.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
                    association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the
                    Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The
                    championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in
                    1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champions are
                    France, who won their second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.

                    The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years,
                    to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams,
                    including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete for the title at venues within the
                    host nation(s) over about a month. <br> As of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, twenty-one final tournaments
                    have been held and a total of 79 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by eight
                    national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every
                    tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina,
                    France, and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title
                    each. <br>The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as
                    well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. The cumulative
                    viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated
                    715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.
                    <br>17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, and Mexico have each
                    hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United
                    States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa, and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar will
                    host the 2022 tournament, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico,
                    which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.

                <div class="para-container">

                    <p class="px-2">Goalkeepers are mostly one-dimensional players. They have one, and only one job on
                        the
                        field – at least only one that invites deep scrutiny – keep the ball out of the net. It is a

                        tremendous task in itself, but what happens when a goalkeeper adds another dimension to his
                        play; a
                        flair for goal scoring? Well, ladies and gentlemen, the answer is simple: Rogerio Ceni. <br>Ceni
                        was
                        a Brazilian goalkeeper who plied his trade for Sao Paulo. He was an excellent goalkeeper and
                        even
                        represented his country at two World Cups. He was also extraordinarily good at set-pieces.

                        In a career spanning two-and-a-half decades, Ceni scored 131 goals. That is more than 60 goals
                        more
                        than the second most goal-rich keeper in history, Jose Luis Chilavert. To put this extraordinary
                        feat into perspective, Ryan Giggs, an attacking player, has scored only 111 goals in the same
                        period
                        that Ceni started taking set pieces for his team. <br>ollowing his retirement, Ceni became the
                        manager of Sao Paulo. His record might still burgeon, but irrespective of his future exploits,
                        his
                        record as the best scoring goalkeeper will surely stand the test of time.</p>

                        Most football fans mistakenly attribute this record to Pele, but Pele is not even second on this
                        list. The record is held by a lesser-known player named <span style="font-weight: bold;">Josef
                            Bican.</span> The football calendar back then
                        was more relaxed, thus enabling the longevity of players' careers. It is almost impossible for
                        players to survive a 1000 games in the modern era.Even if they did come close to 1000 games,
                        like
                        Giggs and Paolo Maldini, it would be impossible to maintain Bican's scoring rate, which was an
                        unbelievable 1.6 goals per game.

                    <p class="px-2 pb-lg-5 pt-lg-3">From 1955 to 1960, Real Madrid went on a rampage, destroying teams
                        en route to their five consecutive European Cups. It is from this their obsession with the
                        Champions League stems.

                        During those five years, Madrid enjoyed a stranglehold over European football unlike any other
                        and set them on their path to become the greatest European side ever.

                        The European Cup's modern equivalent, the Champions League, has yet to be defended even once.
                        Forget five times; teams can't even manage to win it twice continuously. Even distinctly
                        powerful teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich have failed.

                        This record is immortal and will never be broken.</p>

                        immortalised by the Guinness book of world records for producing the biggest scoreline in club
                        football. <br>The match, played in Madagascar, was a part of a four-team round-robin tournament
                        to determine the national champion. SO l'Emyrne, dismayed at poor refereeing in a previous
                        match, which effectively ended their hopes of becoming champions, took to the match to protest
                        against biased refereeing. A most unusual protest. <br>As soon as the whistle went, the SO
                        l'Emyrne players proceeded to pass back to their own goal and score. The opposition were
                        bewildered, but the team had made their mind. <br>They went on to score 149 own goals leading to
                        a score of 149-0. In the aftermath of the match, the SO l'Emyrne manager was banned from the
                        game for three years, and 4 of the team players were banned until the end of the season.</p>

                        career spanning 13 years and 149 matches, Daei managed to score an impressive 109 goals for
                        Iran. <br>During his incredible career, he managed to play for giants such as Bayern Munich and
                        Hertha BSC. He was handpicked by Beckenbauer as a world-class forward when he was signed for the
                        German giants. During his stay in Bayern, he also became the first Asian player to play in the
                        UEFA Champions League. <br>He is the only player to have crossed the century mark for goals in
                        international football, and it will take a superhuman effort to match or even break his record.

                        With 102 international goals to his name as things stand, Cristiano Ronaldo should break the
                        record in the coming years. The Portuguese attackers is one of the greatest footballers of all
                        time and his ludicrous goalscoring exploits over the years makes him the highest-scoring

                        the golden boot, but it wasn't enough in the 1958 edition. In his first, and what would be his
                        only, World Cup, Just Fontaine smashed all kinds of goalscoring records, scoring an impressive
                        13 goals en route to France's third-place finish.

                        The highest goals scored in World Cups stands at 16. Fontaine managed 13 in only one edition. As
                        of now, the Frenchman is fourth in the list of most goals at the World Cup, but the record for
                        goals scored in a single edition will likely always be his.</p>

                    approximately 190–200 national teams partake in respective qualifying tournaments on a continental
                    confederation level for a place in the main tournament. The main tournament is held every four years
                    and involves 32 national teams spanning over four weeks. The first competition was the 1930 FIFA
                    World Cup in Uruguay.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of
                    eleven players each (Cricket). One team, which is batting, tries to score runs, while the other team
                    is fielding, and tries to prevent this. Runs are scored by hitting the ball, which is thrown by a
                    player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team, across the boundary, or by the two
                    batting players running back-and-forth between the two wickets. <br>The wickets are sets of three
                    small, wooden posts that are at each end of a rectangle of short grass called 'the pitch', which is
                    22 yards long. The pitch is inside a much larger oval of grass called the 'area of play'. The area
                    of play is a 30 yard circle inside the cricket ground or stadium. The fielding team can attempt to
                    get batting players "out" in a number of ways. When a player is out, a teammate will replace them in
                    the field. When a team no longer has two "not-out" players left to score, then the other team gets
                    the chance to try to score. In shorter games of cricket, a team may also have to stop batting when
                    the ball has been thrown to their players a certain number of times. After both teams have had
                    enough chances to score, the team with the most runs wins. <br>A cricket field is where cricket is
                    played. It is circular or oval-shaped grassy ground. There are no fixed dimensions for the field.
                    Its diameter usually varies between 450 feet (137 m) to 500 feet (152 m).</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">RULES AND REGULATIONS</h3>
                <p>There are two teams: The team bowling has 11 players on the field. The team batting has two players,
                    one at each end of the pitch (also sometimes called the wicket).
                <ul>
                    <li>The rest of the batting team are off the field.</li>
                    <li>Runs are got after a ball is bowled, mostly by hitting the ball and running, or by hitting the
                        ball to or over the boundary.</li>
                </ul>
                The captain of the bowling team chooses a bowler from his team; the other players are called 'fielders'.
                <ul>
                    <li>The bowler is trying to aim the ball at a wicket, which is made up of three sticks (called
                        stumps) stuck into the earth, with two small sticks (called bails) balanced on them.</li>
                    <li>One of the fielders, called the 'wicket keeper', stands behind the wicket to catch the ball if
                        the bowler misses the wicket.</li>
                    <li>The other fielders may chase the ball after the batsman has hit it.</li>
                </ul>
                The bowler runs towards his wicket, and bowls towards the batsman at the other wicket.
                <ul>
                    <li>He does not throw the ball. He bowls the ball overarm with a "straight arm" (defined further in
                        the rules and the guidance to umpires). If he bends his arm, the other teams are given one run
                        and he has to bowl the ball again.</li>
                    <li>An 'over' is six balls, meaning he bowls six times. Then another player becomes the bowler for
                        the next over, and bowls from the other end, and so on. The same bowler cannot bowl two overs
                        one after the other.</li>
                </ul>
                The batsman is trying to defend the wicket from getting hit with the ball. He does this with a bat. When
                he hits the ball with his bat, he may run toward the other wicket.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To score a run:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The two batsmen must both run from their wicket to the other wicket before they can be
                                run out. Being run out is explained below. The batsmen can run between the wickets as
                                many times as they want, with one run scored each time they do this.</li>
                            <li>If the ball leaves the field after being hit without bouncing, six runs are scored.</li>
                            <li>If the ball rolls or bounces out, whether or not the batter hit it, it counts as four
                                runs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                There are different ways that a batsman can get out. The most common ways are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The batsman misses the ball and the ball hits the wicket: called bowled, or being "bowled out".
                    </li>
                    <li>The ball hits the batsman's body when it would have hit the wicket otherwise. Called LBW (leg
                        before wicket). The way this rule is applied is complicated; this is just the general idea.</li>
                    <li>A fielder catches the ball after the batsman hits it, and before it bounces or leaves the field:
                        called caught.</li>
                    <li>While the batsmen are running, a fielder can throw the ball at the wicket. If the batsmen cannot
                        finish the run in time, and the ball hits the wicket, the batsman nearer to the wicket that is
                        hit is out: this is called run out.</li>
                </ul>
                When a batsman is out, another comes onto the field to take his place. The innings is over when ten
                wickets are taken (i.e. ten of the eleven batsmen are out). After this, the team which was the
                'fielding' team becomes the 'batting' team. They now have to score more runs than the other team managed
                to score. If they score more runs before ten wickets are taken, they win. If they do not, the other team
                wins. <br>In a one-day game, each side has one innings, and innings are limited to a certain number of
                overs. In longer formats each side has two innings, and there is no specific limit to the number of
                overs in an innings.

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY</h3>
                <p>There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during Saxon or Norman
                    times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east
                    England. The first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, and in the same
                    year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game. There is also the thought that cricket may have
                    derived from bowls, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its
                    target by hitting it away.</p>
                <p>Village cricket had developed by the middle of the 17th century and the first English “county teams”
                    were formed in the second half of the century, as “local experts” from village cricket were employed
                    as the earliest professionals. The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709.
                </p>
                <p>In the first half of the 18th Century cricket established itself as a leading sport in London and the
                    south-eastern counties of England. Its spread was limited by the constraints of travel, but it was
                    slowly gaining popularity in other parts of England and Women’s Cricket dates back to the 1745, when
                    the first known match was played in Surrey.</p>
                <p>In 1744, the first Laws of Cricket were written and subsequently amended in 1774, when innovations
                    such as lbw, a 3rd stump, - the middle stump and a maximum bat width were added. The codes were
                    drawn up by the “Star and Garter Club” whose members ultimately founded the famous Marylebone
                    Cricket Club at Lord's in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made
                    revisions ever since then to the current day.</p>
                <p>Rolling the ball along the ground was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the
                    ball and in response to that innovation the straight bat replaced the old “hockey-stick” style of
                    bat. The Hambledon Club in Hampshire was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until
                    the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Cricket Ground in 1787.</p>
                <p>Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies as early as the 17th century, and in
                    the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the West Indies by
                    colonists and to India by British East India Company mariners. It arrived in Australia almost as
                    soon as colonisation began in 1788 and the sport reached New Zealand and South Africa in the early
                    years of the 19th century.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY OF WORLCUP</h3>
                <p>The Cricket World Cup (officially known as ICC Men's Cricket World Cup) is the international
                    championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing
                    body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification
                    rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting
                    events and is considered the "flagship event of the international cricket calendar" by the ICC.</p>
                <p>The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having
                    been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two
                    years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had
                    been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between
                    Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987
                    tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system,
                    with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.</p>
                <p>The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years,
                    to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 10 teams,
                    including the automatically qualifying host nation, compete for the title at venues within the host
                    nation over about a month. In the 2027 edition, the format will be changed to accommodate an
                    expanded 14-team final competition.</p>
                <p>A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with ten teams
                    competing in the recent 2019 tournament. Australia has won the tournament five times, India and West
                    Indies twice each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it once each. The best performance
                    by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.</p>
                <p>England are the current champions after winning the 2019 World Cup edition. The next tournament will
                    be held in India in 2023 and the subsequent 2027 World Cup will be held jointly in South Africa,
                    Zimbabwe and Namibia</p>

                    <p class="px-2 pt-2">The first name that appears in most runs in first-class cricket is the
                        superstar from England, Jack Hobbs. He has been the most prolific runs scorer when we talk about
                        first-class cricket. If there had not been the world war intervention, he would have scored much
                        more runs than one could have anticipated.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">Hobbs’s best ability is that he could attack and defend in a short span of time,
                        which made it harder for the bowlers to bow to him. To the readers who are unaware, Jack is the
                        first player to be named as the master, and he played beyond the age of 50 years. His fitness
                        was at a peak.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">In total, his first-class career spanned a period of 29 years with the bat. In that
                        time frame, the batter was able to be part of 834 matches and score 61760 runs with the bat in
                        hand. The average of 50.70 over such a long period is worth appreciating. Along with it, he had
                        199 first-class hundred, a record which will never be beaten.</p>

                        when he totaled 905 runs on the Australian tour of 1928-29. In the next Ashes Series played in
                        England, one of the greatest batsmen, Don Bradman, broke that record and made 974 runs in the
                        five-match series.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">His scores read 8 & 131 at Trent Bridge, 254 & 1 at Lord’s, 334 at Headingley, 14 in
                        Manchester, and finally 232 at the Oval. The closest anyone has come to breaking Bradman’s
                        record is when Vivian Richards Scored 829 runs out of the same opponent in 1976.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">The 1932 win by Australia ended England’s six-year hold on the Ashes. The exploits
                        of Bradman were celebrated in the cricketing world. Everyone now acknowledged that he was the
                        ultimate batsman in the world.</p>

                    <p class="px-2 pt-2">On December 17, 1992, Pakistan were bamboozled by one of the most remarkable
                        spells by the West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons. Sydney Cricket Ground played host to the
                        most economical spell in One-Day International (ODI) history as West Indies comprehensively
                        trumped Pakistan in a Benson and Hedges World Series encounter. Simmons was more known for his
                        hard hitting batting, but on the day his bowling stole the limelight and helped his side defend
                        a smallish total.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">With Pakistan chasing 215 for victory, many would have expected a Curtly Ambrose or
                        a Patrick Patterson to do the damage. However, it was Simmons who had a field day. When compared
                        to the burly figures of Ambrose and Patterson, Simmons was smaller, but his wily medium pace was
                        enough to trouble Pakistan.
                        Patterson opened the flood gates for West Indies by dismissing Rameez Raja. Then followed the
                        Simmons burst as he snared the next four wickets in the space of 10 runs. Asif Mujtaba dragged a
                        shortish delivery on to his woodowork and Aamer Sohail skied an edge to mid-off. Salim Malik was
                        caught by surprise as he couldn’t keep a rising delivery down. It went from bad to worse for
                        Pakistan as their captain Javed Miandad edged an away-swinging delivery to the keeper to make it
                        14 for five.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">Simmons was awarded the man-of-the-match for his figures of 10-8-3-4 – which remain
                        the most economical figures in ODIs. He beat Dermot Reeve’s analysis of 5-3-2-1 which also came
                        against Pakistan in March 1992. Only Ambrose has come close to replicating that in the years
                        that followed when he bowled a miserly spell of 10-5-5-1 against Sri Lanka in 1999.</p>

                        December 2005 to 2 January 2008. In both instances Australia's run was halted by India. Between
                        26 December 2005 and 2 January 2008, the Australia cricket captain Ricky Ponting led his team on
                        a record-equalling run of 16 consecutive test match victories, matching the winning streak
                        achieved by his predecessor Steve Waugh in the period from 14 October 1999 to 27 February 2001.
                        Crucially, Ponting skippered his side on the field in all 16 matches, whereas Waugh had done so
                        in only 15, having missed the 13th test, against the West Indies in Adelaide, because of a
                        muscle injury.</p>

                    <p class="px-2">Muttiah Muralitharan tops the list of bowlers with the most number of wickets taken
                        in all three formats of international cricket (combined) – Tests + ODIs + T20Is.His fellow

                        field, remains at the pinnacle of batting in international cricket. Also revered as the God of
                        Cricket, Tendulkar has breached the century mark a total of 100 times in his glorious career –
                        51 in Tests and 49 in ODIs.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">Behind him – and by miles – is former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting with 71
                        centuries. India’s talismanic batsman Virat Kohli has often been touted to break Tendulkar’s 100
                        centuries record. However, Kohli has been stuck on 70 international tons for the last two years,
                        and it seems that the 33-year-old won’t surpass Tendulkar as was believed earlier.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">With 34357 international runs – 15,921 runs in ODIs and 18,426 runs in Tests –
                        Tendulkar continues to remain the all-time leading run-scorer at the highest level; Kohli has
                        amassed 23358 runs so far. This records tops our list of unbreakable records in cricket.</p>

                    South Africa as full nations. Later West Indies, New Zealand and India joined them in 1926 while
                    Pakistan entered in 1952 post their partition with India before the ICC changed its name as
                    International Cricket Council in 1965.</p>
                <p>Here is the list of full members nation of ICC:
                <ul>
                    <li>England</li>
                    <li>Australia</li>
                    <li>India</li>

                <p>Among these 12 nations, only Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe Bangladesh, Ireland and Afghanistan have played as
                    the associate nations under ICC before becoming full members. Afghanistan’s progress is visible by
                    the fact that they needed only 4 years from being the Associate nation and Full members.
                    Interestingly, Ireland took the longest for earning the promotion as its been 24 years since they
                    were granted the associate nation status in 1993.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION AND STRATEGY</h3>
                <p>Judo is a martial art that was first created by Sensei Jigoro Kano. This system of martial arts
                    teaches physical, intellectual, and moral education. Judo also emphasizes respect for the other
                    person. </p>
                <p>Judo is a system of physical education and training, but it also teaches moral values. These values
                    prepare students to become contributing members of their communities, countries, and world.
                    Ultimately, judo students become active members of their society and help create a better world.</p>
                <p>The philosophy behind Judo is that a person can develop his or her body and mind by learning
                    physical, intellectual, and moral arts. Judo emphasizes the use of self-defense techniques. It
                    involves a lot of grappling on the ground. In addition, Judo emphasizes safety and physical activity
                    for top conditioning. It is learned on special mats to ensure safety. Judo is practiced by students
                    with a sensei. Senseis are considered lifelong guides to most martial artists.</p>
                <p>Judo strategy is based on three elements—rapid movement, flexibility, and leverage—each of which
                    translates into a competitive principle. The first principle requires judo players to move rapidly
                    to new markets and uncontested ground, thus avoiding head-to-head combat.</p>
                <p>Judo is also good for children because it teaches respect for other people. Parents may be worried
                    about the techniques being used, but instructors remind students not to hurt or intimidate other
                    people. This helps children learn how to respect the strength and techniques they are learning</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">RULES AND REGULATIONS</h3>
                <p>Judo was initially being used as a self-defence technique involving much deadly practice. Later, it
                    has been modified for safe practice among the students. So International Judo Federation added many
                    rules to make it safe.</p>
                <p>The rules regarding safety in Judo are as follows
                <ul>
                    <li>Intentionally harming an opponent is abandoned.</li>
                    <li>One cannot punch or kick his opponent.</li>
                    <li>You cannot touch the opponent’s face.</li>
                    <li>Attacking the joints other than elbows is not allowed.</li>
                    <li>Head dives are also not permitted.</li>
                    <li>Some techniques like Kawazu gake and Kami basami are not allowed.</li>
                    <li>Neither of the competitors is allowed to wear any hard metallic object during the competition.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Etiquette in Judo</span> <br>Before stepping into the mat, the
                    contestant must bow. Before starting and after ending the game the contestant must bow to each other
                    and also to the competition area. If anyone will use bad body gesture or use foul languages, then
                    he/she will be debarred from the tournament.</p>
                <p>Stalling is not permitted in the game. One cannot use defensive posture either. If one disregards the
                    order of the judge, then he/she will be disqualified for the entire tournament.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Judo-Competition Area</span> <br>It must be played upon a stage of
                    having a minimum size of 14×14 meters. The rules also say that the stage must be built from tatami.
                    It is a mat that is used for the flooring purpose of the traditional martial arts of Japan.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penalities In Judo</span> <br>Generally, two types of penalties are
                    there in Judo. One is shido and another is hansoku. Shido is awarded when a competitor remains in
                    longer period of nonaggression. It is also awarded for minor rule breach. After two warnings, one
                    shido is awarded. Number of shidos decides the winner in case the match ends in tie.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, four shidos will make one hansoku. Hansoku is also awarded for major rule
                    violation. There may be a chance that he/she may get disqualified from the tournament.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY</h3>
                <p>Kodokan Judo was founded by Kano Jigoro Shihan, who as a youth began practicing Jujutsu* as a way to
                    strengthen his frail body. Kano studied both the Tenjin Shinyo-ryu and Kito-ryu styles of classical
                    Jujutsu, eventually mastering their deepest teachings, and supplemented this training with an avid
                    interest in other combative forms as well. Integrating what he considered the positive points of
                    these with his own ideas and inspirations, he established a revised body of physical technique, and
                    also transformed the traditional Jujutsu principle of "defeating strength through flexibility" into
                    a new principle of "maximum efficient use of physical and mental energy." The result was a new
                    theoretical and technical system that Kano felt better matched the needs of modern people.</p>
                <p>The essence of this system he expressed in the axiom "maximum efficient use of energy", a concept he
                    considered both a cornerstone of martial arts and a principle useful in many aspects of life.
                    Practical application of this principle, he felt, could contribute much to human and social
                    development, including "mutual prosperity for self and others", which he identified as the proper
                    goal of training. What Kano had created transcended mere technique to embrace a set of principles
                    for perfecting the self. To reflect this, he replaced jutsu (technique) in the word "Ju-jutsu" with
                    the suffix do (path) to create a new name for his art: judo. His training hall he named "Ko-do-kan,"
                    or "a place to teach the path."</p>
                <p>Kano has also been lauded as "the father of Japanese physical education." As principal of Tokyo
                    Higher Normal School, he established a general physical education faculty aimed at training teachers
                    capable of bringing quality physical education to Japan's youth. He also helped found the Japan
                    Amateur Sports Association (Japan Sport Association), and in 1909 he became the first Asian member
                    of the International Olympic Committee.
                    Kano traveled abroad thirteen times, lecturing and demonstrating Judo in order to introduce his art
                    to people around the world.</p>
                <p>Today, the International Judo Federation includes representatives from about 204 countries and
                    regions (as of 2020), with practitioners from all walks of life donning judo uniforms and stepping
                    onto the mat to forge their minds, bodies, and spirits.</p>
                <p>The following is a part of the preamble in the statutes of the International Judo Federation:
                    Judo was created in 1882 by Kano Jigoro Shihan. As an educational method derived from the martial
                    arts, judo became an official Olympic sport in 1964 (after being named as a demonstration sport at
                    the 1940 Tokyo Olympic Games which were cancelled due to international conflict). Judo is a highly
                    codified sport in which the mind controls the expression of the body and is a sport which
                    contributes to educating individuals.</p>
                <p>As a discipline derived from ancestral traditions, judo was designed by its Master Founder as an
                    eminently modern and progressive activity.

                <p>The World Judo Championships are the highest level of international judo competition, along with the
                    Olympic judo competition. The championships are held once every year (except the years when the
                    Olympics take place) by the International Judo Federation, and qualified judoka compete in their
                    respective categories as representatives of their home countries. Team competitions have also been
                    held since 1994. The men's championships began in 1956, though the format and periodicity of the
                    championships have changed over time. The last edition of the championships took place in Budapest,
                    Hungary in 2021.</p>
                <p>The first edition of the world championships took place in Tokyo, Japan in 1956. There were no weight
                    classes at the time and Japanese judoka Shokichi Natsui became the first world champion in history,
                    defeating fellow countryman Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu in the final. The second world championship was
                    also held in Tokyo two years later, with the Japanese winning the top two spots in the competition
                    for the second time. In 1961, the championship was held outside Japan for the first time, and Dutch
                    judoka Anton Geesink defeated the prior world champion, Koji Sone, in Paris, France, to become the
                    first non-Japanese world champion.</p>
                <p>The 1965 World Judo Championships were held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and weight classes were
                    implemented for the first time with the addition of the −68 kg, −80 kg, and +80 kg categories. Judo
                    had become an Olympic sport at the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, and a permanent sport after a
                    brief absence at the 1968 Summer Olympics.</p>
                <p>Despite this progressive enlargement, it took until 1980 for women to participate in the world
                    championships. The first women's world championships were held in New York City in 1980, and were
                    held in alternating years as the men's championships until the 1987 World Judo Championships in
                    Essen, where the two competitions were merged into one world championship. The mixed championships
                    have been held biannually since 1987. In 2005, the world championships made its debut on the African
                    continent in Cairo, Egypt. In the International Judo Federation meeting held in Rio de Janeiro,
                    Brazil in 2007 (during the 2007 World Judo Championships), it was decided that France would host the
                    world championships for the fifth time in 2011.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">INTRODUCTION AND STRATEGY</h3>
                <p>Tennis, original name lawn tennis, game in which two opposing players (singles) or pairs of players
                    (doubles) use tautly strung rackets to hit a ball of specified size, weight, and bounce over a net
                    on a rectangular court. Points are awarded to a player or team whenever the opponent fails to
                    correctly return the ball within the prescribed dimensions of the court. Organized tennis is played
                    according to rules sanctioned by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the world governing body
                    of the sport.</p>
                <p>Tennis originally was known as lawn tennis, and formally still is in Britain, because it was played
                    on grass courts by Victorian gentlemen and ladies. It is now played on a variety of surfaces. The
                    origins of the game can be traced to a 12th–13th-century French handball game called jeu de paume
                    (“game of the palm”), from which was derived a complex indoor racket-and-ball game: real tennis.
                    This ancient game is still played to a limited degree and is usually called real tennis in Britain,
                    court tennis in the United States, and royal tennis in Australia.</p>
                <p>Players use different strategies while playing tennis to enhance their own strengths and exploit
                    their opponent's weaknesses in order to gain the advantage and win more points.</p>
                <p>Players typically specialize or naturally play in a certain way, based on what they can do best.
                    Based on their style, players generally fit into one of three types, baseliners, volleyers,
                    all-court players. Many players have attributes of all three categories but, at times, may also
                    focus on just one style based on the surface, or on the condition, or on the opponent.</p>
                <p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">baseliner</span> plays from the back of the tennis court,
                    around/behind/within the baseline, preferring to hit groundstrokes, thereby allowing themselves more
                    time to react to their opponent's shots, rather than to come up to the net (except in certain
                    situations). Many modern professional players employ this style most of the time.</p>
                <p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">volleyer</span> plays nearer towards the net, preferring to hit
                    volleys, whereby providing their opponent less time to react to their shots, rather than to
                    stay/play from further back on the tennis court (except in certain situations). Many classic
                    traditional players employed this style the best in the past.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">All-court</span> players fall somewhere in between, employing both
                    baseliner strategies and volleyer strategies depending on the situations.</p>
                <p>A player's weaknesses may also determine strategy. For example, most players typically have a
                    stronger forehand shot and therefore they will favor the forehand, hence will re-balance their
                    posture and re-adjust their position by "running around" a more logical backhand cross-court to
                    enable them to hit an inside-out forehand instead. Or likewise, some players with a more dominant
                    backhand shot and hence they will instead favor the backhand, thus will switch their stance, change
                    their hand grip and with "quick footwork" hit a backhand down-the-line instead of a more convenient
                    inside-in forehand.</p>

                        Equipment</span> <br></p>
                <p>The baseline marks the back of the rectangular shaped court. There are two service areas either side
                    of the net. These are the landing zones for successful serves.Two tram lines run down either side of
                    the court. Singles matches use the inner side tram line whereas doubles games use the outer tram
                    line.</p>
                <p>A competition tennis court measures 23.77 meters long (78 feet). It should be 8.23 meters wide (27
                    feet) for singles matches and 10.97 meters (36 feet) for playing a game of doubles.

                    Tennis court dimensions are standard for games played on all surfaces. That includes clay, grass,
                    carpet, and hard concrete pitches.</p>
                <p>The rules and regulations of tennis govern some basic equipment needed to play the game. Players must
                    use their own stringed racket to play and they will need some tennis balls. As a rule, typical
                    sports attire will suffice.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:18px ;">Serving Rules</span> <br>The quest for points begins
                    with a 'serve' and the one hitting the ball over the net gets called the server. Player service
                    alternates after each game gets completed. A tennis umpire officiates and regulates all professional
                    level matches.</p>
                <p>Servers have two attempts to deliver the ball without error. The ball must land inside the opponent's
                    service box. If not, the server loses the point.

                    A 'let' gets called if the ball makes contact with the net but falls into their box. In this case,
                    the serve should then get repeated without a penalty to either player.

                    A rally of cross-court shots ensue as the players hit the ball back and forth to each other. They
                    must play rallies within the boundaries of the court.

                    You win a point if the ball bounces more than once in your opponent's side or if they fail to return
                    it to you.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:18px ;">GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most tennis tournaments begin with a coin toss. Flipping a coin determines which player will
                        serve first and which side of the court to serve from.</li>
                    <li>The server will serve the ball and alternate sides on the base line after each point. The
                        server's feet must not move in front of the baseline before they stroke the ball over the net.
                    </li>
                    <li>Failing to get the first serve 'in' means they can take advantage to play a second serve. A
                        double fault gets called if they fail to get their second serve in. The player would lose that
                        point.</li>
                    <li>The player who receives the serve can position themselves anywhere they like. The ball must
                        bounce once before returning the serve to avoid losing the point.</li>
                    <li>General play can include an unlimited number of strokes between each other after a serve. The
                        aim is to win the point during the rally. You score the point by hitting the ball in such a way
                        that your opponent fails to return it to the scoring areas.</li>
                    <li>Points in tennis get awarded in scores represented by 15, 30, and 40. According to the main
                        rules of tennis 15 will represent 1 point, 30 means 2 points, and 40 results in 3 points.
                        Scoring 4 points wins the game.</li>
                    <li>Tennis games often land on a score of 40-40 (known as 'deuce' in tennis terminologies). A player
                        needs to win by two (2) consecutive points to win a game after reaching deuce. The 1st point won
                        after a tied position of deuce is 'advantage'. Winning the next point means they win the game.
                        But, losing the next point means that particular game returns to deuce.</li>
                    <li>A player needs to win 6 games by a margin of at least 2 games to win the set. The opening sets
                        go to a tie break if they finish at 6-6 in games played to 7 points. But, the final set does not
                        play out the typical tie break scenario. Most tennis rules and regulations require a player to
                        win by two clear games. There are no upper limits to playing out this scenario. The Wimbledon
                        Tennis Tournament is famous for tense moments like these.</li>
                    <li>You must return the ball into the scoring areas on the court to avoid losing a point. This must
                        take place before the ball bounces twice. You also lose the point if the ball hits the net and
                        fails to drop into the opponent's area. Players also lose points in tennis by automatic process
                        if:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They make contact with the net.</li>
                            <li>Distract their opponent.</li>
                            <li>Impede their opponent's game in any way.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The ball is 'in play' even if it hits any part of the boundary lines. But, it gets called 'out'
                        if it lands outside the outer court lines.</li>
                    <li>Professional regulations of tennis govern the use of new balls during a match. As a rule, old
                        balls get changed for new balls after every 6 games.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:18px ;">Scoring</span><br>Each player tries to be the first
                    to score four points and win the game. A simple explanation of the scoring points in tennis would
                    be:
                <ul>
                    <li>15 (one point)</li>
                    <li>30 (two points)</li>
                    <li>40 (three points)</li>
                    <li>Winning the 'fourth point' would be the winning point to end that particular game. Special
                        tennis rules apply for games scored at 40-40 (deuce).</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:18px ;">Winning A Game</span><br>As a general rule in tennis
                    there is a maximum of three sets played in the women's game and five in men's tennis matches.

                    To win the game you must win a certain amount of sets (best of three for women's matches and best of
                    5 sets for men's games).

                    The first player to reach 6 games wins the set providing the margin is by at least 2 games. Thus,
                    you need to win the set at 7-5 if your opponent wins 5 games.

                    The tennis tie break rules apply to sets reaching a score of 6-6 where the winner is the first
                    player to reach 7 points.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY</h3>
                <p>There has been much dispute over the invention of modern tennis, but the officially recognized
                    centennial of the game in 1973 commemorated its introduction by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in
                    1873. He published the first book of rules that year and took out a patent on his game in 1874,
                    although historians have concluded that similar games were played earlier and that the first tennis
                    club was established by the Englishman Harry Gem and several associates in Leamington in 1872.
                    Wingfield’s court was of the hourglass shape and may have developed from badminton. The hourglass
                    shape, stipulated by Wingfield in his booklet “Sphairistiké, or Lawn Tennis,” may have been adopted
                    for patent reasons since it distinguished the court from ordinary rectangular courts. At the time,
                    the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was the governing body of real tennis, whose rules it had recently
                    revised. After J.M. Heathcote, a distinguished real tennis player, developed a better tennis ball of
                    rubber covered with white flannel, the MCC in 1875 established a new, standardized set of rules for
                    tennis.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the game had spread to the United States in the 1870s. Mary Outerbridge of New York has
                    been credited with bringing a set of rackets and balls to her brother, a director of the Staten
                    Island Cricket and Baseball Club. But research has shown that William Appleton of Nahant,
                    Massachusetts, may have owned the first lawn tennis set and that his friends James Dwight and Fred
                    R. Sears popularized the game.</p>
                <p>An important milestone in the history of tennis was the decision of the All England Croquet Club to
                    set aside one of its lawns at Wimbledon for tennis, which soon proved so popular that the club
                    changed its name to the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club. In 1877 the club decided to hold a
                    tennis championship, and a championship subcommittee of three was appointed. It decided on a
                    rectangular court 78 feet (23.8 metres) long by 27 feet (8.2 metres) wide. They adapted the real
                    tennis method of scoring—15, 30, 40, game—and allowed the server one fault (i.e., two chances to
                    deliver a proper service on each point). These major decisions remain part of the modern rules.
                    Twenty-two entries were received, and the first winner of the Wimbledon Championships was Spencer
                    Gore. In 1878 the Scottish Championships were held, followed in 1879 by the Irish Championships.</p>
                <p>Tennis had taken firm root in Australia by 1880, and the first Australian Championships were played
                    in 1905. The first national championships in New Zealand were held in 1886. In 1904 the Lawn Tennis
                    Association of Australasia (later of Australia) was founded.</p>
                <p>The first French Championships were held at the Stade Français in 1891, but it was an interclub
                    tournament that did not become truly international until 1925; the French Federation of Lawn Tennis
                    was established in 1920. Other national championships were inaugurated in Canada (1890), South
                    Africa (1891), Spain (1910), Denmark (1921), Egypt (1925), Italy (1930), and Sweden (1936). In 1884
                    a women’s championship was introduced at Wimbledon, and women’s national championships were held in
                    the United States starting in 1887.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wimbledon</li>

                </ul>
                But Wimbledon is the most prestigious tennis tournament.
                </p>
                <p>The Wimbledon Championships, commonly known simply as Wimbledon, is the oldest tennis tournament in
                    the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious.It has been held at the All England Club in
                    Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, with retractable roofs over the
                    two main courts since 2019.</p>
                <p>The tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the
                    last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for
                    the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with
                    additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court
                    was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was
                    operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including
                    adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the
                    games.</p>
                <p>Wimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage.
                    Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. Unlike other tournaments,
                    advertising is minimal and low key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex.</p>
                <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Wimbledon was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament
                    since World War II. The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021,
                    following from the 2020 cancellation. The 135th edition was played between 27 June 2022 and 10 July
                    2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred on the middle Sunday for the first time. It marks the
                    centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did not
                    award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament banning players
                    representing Russia and Belarus.</p>

                    <p class="px-2">The longest tennis match was played at Wimbledon in 2010. American John Isner, the
                        world No. 19 at the time, played against Frenchman Nicolas Mahut, No. 148 in the rankings. The
                        clear favorite had not been able to break his opponent for three days. After three breaks due to
                        darkness and a postponement, Isner won 70-68. The game lasted 11 hours and five minutes.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">The record for the longest match has been held in the women’s singles since 1984.
                        Two American women Vicki Nelson-Dunbar and Jean Hepner played against each other in Richmond.

                        Slam tournaments, which is the current record. The Swiss has won all kinds of Grand Slam
                        tournaments.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">Roger also has a record of winning two consecutive Grand Slams five times in a row.
                        Federer has won six times at the Australian Open and eight times at Wimbledon, which is also an

                        sharing the record with Federer at 81. In those 81 tournaments, Federer won 369 matches, another
                        stat in which no-one has surpassed the Swiss. When he won his 100th, he became the first men's

                    Lisicki set the record among women. The speed of the ball after her serve was 210 km/h. It happened
                    on July 9, 2014, in the first round match at Stanford.</p>
                <h4 class="px-2 pt-4">The largest number of aces</h4>
                <p class="px-2">The Croatian Goran Ivanisevic has the most aces during the season among men. In the 1996
                    season, he hit 1,477 aces.

                    American John Isner holds the record for the most aces per match. He had 113 aces in 2010 at
                    Wimbledon against Frenchman Nicolas Mahut. That was the exact match that lasted three days.</p>

                <p>The International Tennis Federation (ITF) is the governing body of world tennis, wheelchair tennis,
                    and beach tennis. It was founded in 1913 as the International Lawn Tennis Federation by twelve
                    national tennis associations. As of 2016, there are 211 national and six regional associations that
                    make up ITF's membership.</p>
                <p>The ITF's governance responsibilities include maintaining and enforcing the rules of tennis,
                    regulating international team competitions, promoting the game, and preserving the sport's integrity
                    via anti-doping and anti-corruption programs. The ITF partners with the Women's Tennis Association
                    (WTA) and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) to govern professional tennis.</p>
                <p>The ITF organizes the Grand Slam events, annual team competitions for men (Davis Cup), women (Billie
                    Jean King Cup), and mixed teams (Hopman Cup), as well as tennis and wheelchair tennis events at the
                    Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games on behalf of the International Olympic Committee. The ITF
                    sanctions the Grand Slam tennis tournaments as well as circuits which span age ranges (junior,
                    professional men and women, and seniors) as well as disciplines (wheelchair tennis; beach tennis).
                    In addition to these circuits, the ITF also maintains rankings for juniors, seniors, wheelchair and
                    beach tennis.</p>
                <p>In October 2019, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) published its first global report on
                    tennis, based on data collected in 195 nations. The publication, analyzing figures from 2017, stated
                    that there were about 87 million tennis players globally. As of the survey period, China registered
                    the highest figure, as roughly 22.5 percent of all tennis players came from this country. The United
                    States and India followed in the list, recording 20.7 percent and 9.2 percent respectively of all
                    tennis players in the world.</p>

                    <p>Motorcycle racing, the recreational and competitive use of motorcycles, a sport practiced by both
                        professionals and amateurs on roads, tracks, closed circuits, and natural terrain.</p>
                    <p>The development of motorcycling largely paralleled and often coincided with the development of
                        automobile sports. There was a class for motorcycles in many of the old town-to-town automobile
                        road races, the Paris-Vienna race, for example. The de Dion tricycle dominated the sport in
                        1897, but two-wheelers like the Werner soon set the stage for an entirely different form of
                        racing. In 1904 the Fédération Internationale du Motocyclisme (renamed the Fédération
                        Internationale Motocycliste [FIM] in 1949) created the international cup, uniting five nations:
                        Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, and Britain. The first international cup race took place in
                        1905 at Dourdan, France. The race for the Tourist Trophy (TT) became the most famous of all
                        European motorcycle races, however. The first TT race took place in 1907 on the Isle of Man, on
                        a course that was the world’s most famous for many decades thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Motorcycle racing in North America began in 1903 with the formation of the Federation of American
                        Motorcyclists in New York City. By 1924 this society evolved into the still-active American
                        Motorcycle Association. Since 1937 the Daytona 200-mile (320-kilometre) race has been the
                        leading U.S. race. It is held on the same road circuit used for the 24-hour Daytona auto race.
                        Grand Prix racing (in the sense of being a major event in the country in which it is held) for
                        motorcycles started in the United States soon after auto racing resumed after the end of World
                        War I. The Belgian motorcycle-racing Grand Prix dates from 1921, while Germany began motorcycle
                        Grand Prix racing in 1925, and the Dutch Grand Prix started that same year.</p>
                    <p>There are about as many forms of motorcycle racing as there are of automobile racing. The main
                        types are road racing, trials, speedway, motocross, drag racing, ice racing, and hill climbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Road races are held on closed courses, parts or all of which may be public roads. The motorcycle
                        road-racing world championships were established in 1949; in these races, machines are divided
                        into several classes based on engine displacement, from 50 cubic cm (3 cubic inches) up through
                        125, 250, 350, 500, and 750 cubic cm. Local clubs and organizations all over the world have
                        their own international road-race meetings throughout the year.</p>
                    <p>Motorcycle trials, which date back to pre-World War I days, are relatively slow, on-and-off
                        highway events of long duration in which speed is not a determining factor. (See motorcycle
                        trial.) Speedway racing, which came into being in the early 1920s in Australia, is conducted on
                        short, flat oval dirt tracks for short distances. The machines used are ultralightweight, with
                        small fuel tanks and small brakes.</p>
                    <p>Motocross is a type of cross-country race consisting of a specified number of laps over a closed
                        course laid out on rough, natural terrain. Motocross racing was introduced in Great Britain and
                        on the European continent in the late 1940s and early ’50s, and by the ’60s it had become a
                        popular spectator sport. It was demonstrated in North America in the 1960s, and the first
                        regularly scheduled series of motocross events there was held in 1970.</p>
                    <p>Motorcycle drag racing is an American event dating from about 1950. This type of racing consists
                        of a series of acceleration, or top speed, contests, each between two racers, on a straight,
                        smooth-surfaced course that is one-quarter mile long. Motorcycle ice racing started in
                        Scandinavia in the 1930s and has spread to other temperate-climate countries. It is held on
                        ovals on frozen lakes or on ice-covered stadium tracks, and the bikes use spiked (studded)
                        tires. Motorcycle hill climbs are uphill-road races in which each rider races against the clock,
                        and only one machine is in motion at any time.</p>

                <p>Grand Prix motorcycle racing is the premier class of motorcycle road racing events held on road
                    circuits sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). Independent motorcycle
                    racing events have been held since the start of the twentieth century and large national events were
                    often given the title Grand Prix. The foundation of the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme as
                    the international governing body for motorcycle sport in 1949 provided the opportunity to coordinate
                    rules and regulations in order that selected events could count towards official World
                    Championships. It is the oldest established motorsport world championship.</p>
                <p>Grand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are unavailable for purchase by the
                    general public and unable to be ridden legally on public roads. This contrasts with the various
                    production-based categories of racing, such as the Superbike World Championship and the Isle of Man
                    TT Races that feature modified versions of road-going motorcycles available to the public. The
                    current top division is known as MotoGP since 2002 when the four-stroke era began. Prior to that,
                    the largest class was 500cc, both of which form a historical continuum as the official World
                    Championship, although all classes have official status.</p>
                <p>The championship is currently divided into four classes: the eponymous MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3 and
                    MotoE. The first three classes use four-stroke engines, while the MotoE class (new in 2019) uses
                    electric motorcycles.</p>
                <p>The most successful rider in Grand Prix history is Giacomo Agostini with 15 titles and 122 race wins.
                    In the top-flight series, Agostini holds the title record with eight, followed by Valentino Rossi
                    with seven and active rider Marc Márquez with six. As of 2020, Rossi holds the record for most
                    top-flight race wins with 89.</p>

                <p>MotoGP riders have three, 45-minute sessions of practice at the end of which a first ranking is
                    established. After a fourth 30-minute session, whose times don’t count, the riders whose times are
                    slower than the first ten take part in a fifteen-minute qualifying session. The fastest two riders
                    from this session are allowed to join the session bringing together the fastest ten riders for
                    another qualifying session used to decide the first twelve places on the grid. Each line is composed
                    of three riders. To qualify each rider must post a time at least equal to 107% of the time achieved
                    by the fastest rider.</p>
                <p>The MotoGP world championship is composed of 20 Grands Prix. Each round lasts between 40 and 45
                    minutes and is run over a distance of between 100 and 130 kilometres, depending on the circuit. A
                    sliding scale of points are awarded at the finish for the first 15 as follows: 25, 20, 15, 13, 11,
                    10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 pt.</p>
                <p>The MotoGP world championship is raced using 1000cc prototypes. Riders have an allocation of 7
                    engines for the whole season. Since 2017, all the teams use the same electronic management system,
                    provided by the championship promoter. Each rider is provided with a limited number of tyres and
                    bikes may carry no more than 22 litres of fuel.</p>

                        Giacomo Agostini—otherwise known as Ago. In 1965, Agostini made his career debut in the 500cc
                        class and in that same year, he went on to celebrate his first victory at the Finnish Grand
                        Prix.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">Through his 14 year career, Agostini won a total of 122 races and was crowned world
                        champion 15 times (across all classes) . Eight titles of these titles were captured in the
                        MotoGP or 500cc classes. This impressive feat makes Agostini the record holder for most world
                        champion titles in MotoGP—closely followed by his compatriot Valentino Rossi with seven world
                        championship titles and the Spaniard Marc Márquez with six championships.</p>

                        Written sources from different continents (North and South Americas, Asia and Europe) state that
                        the
                        creator of volleyball is the director of Holyoke College, physical education instructor, W. G.
                        Morgan. He wanted to replace less emotional gymnastic exercises with an undemanding and
                        attractive
                        form of physical activity. He divided the gym into two halves by a tennis net (in the height of
                        approx. 183 cm) and let students to volley a basketball ball from one half to the other.

                        Volleyball originated in 1895 in Springfield, Massachusetts (USA). The original name
                        “mintonette”
                        was changed in 1896 when the game was presented to YMCA directors into to volley the ball. Heavy
                        basketball ball was not suitable for the game and the ball bladder did not last long.Morgan had
                        the
                        first volleyball ball made following special calculations thus eliminating an important obstacle
                        in
                        further development of volleyball. In 1896, the structure of volleyball was set by the rules

                    <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">POSITIONS</h3>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outside Hitter-</span>An outside hitter hits and blocks from the
                        left side of the court. Normally, they also carry the responsibilities of passing and playing
                        defense when they get to the back row. The outside typically gets the most sets, especially when
                        the
                        setter is out of system, due to the fact that the outside set is one of the easier options to
                        set.
                        An outside’s responsibilities include hitting from the front and back row, passing in serve
                        receive,
                        playing left or middle-back defense, and blocking.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposite Hitter-</span>Opposite hitters earned that title
                        because
                        they are opposite to the strong (left) side hitter, meaning they hit behind the setter. In a
                        6-1,
                        just like an outside hitter, an opposite has the option to play all the way around, passing,
                        playing
                        defense, and hitting out of the back row. An opposite’s responsibilities include swinging from
                        the
                        front and back row, playing right-back defense, and blocking the other team’s outside hitter.
                    </p>


                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Middle Blocker-</span>Middle blockers are the team’s best
                        blockers,
                        and they hit mostly fast-tempo sets from the middle of the court and behind the setter.
                        Typically
                        the libero goes in for the middle when he or she rotates to the back row. Middle sets are some
                        of
                        the most difficult to set and require good passes, therefore middles often get the fewest sets
                        but
                        have the best hitting percentages.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setter-</span>A setter’s primary responsibility is to take the
                        second ball and set it up for one of the hitters to attack. Often referred to as the
                        quarterback,
                        the setter is the decision maker of the team and is in charge of leading the offense. In a 6-1,
                        the
                        setter plays all the way around, meaning that he or she has defensive responsibilities, as well
                        as
                        blocking duties when in the front row. A setter’s responsibilities include setting the ball on
                        the
                        second contact to the hitters on the court, directing the offense, playing right-back defense,
                        and
                        blocking the other team’s outside hitter.</p>


                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Libero-</span>Liberos wear a jersey of a different color and
                        play in
                        the back row five out the six rotations, usually subbing in for both middle blockers. When the
                        libero comes in for another player, it does not count as a substitution. Liberos are defensive
                        and
                        serve-receive specialists who are typically fast and are able to change direction quickly.
                        Liberos
                        are not permitted to attack the ball from above the height of the net, and they can only
                        overhand
                        set a front-row attacker from behind the 10-foot line.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Defensive Specialists-</span>Much like a libero, a defensive
                        specialist plays in the back row and is responsible for playing defense and receiving serve.
                        Unlike
                        the libero, they do not wear different colored jerseys and are required to abide by the normal
                        substitution rules, meaning they are only in for three out of the six rotations.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Serving Specialist -</span>A serving specialist is a player who
                        subs
                        in just to serve. These players typically have a very tough or very consistent serve, and they
                        come
                        in for a player who is less strong behind the service line, but otherwise very valuable to have
                        on
                        the court as an offensive or defensive threat.</p>

                </div>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pitch Measurements-</span>Volleyball Courts are flat horizontal
                    playing surfaces sized for the game of volleyball. Indoor volleyball court surfaces are required to
                    be made of resilient wood flooring or poured with a synthetic urethane. The size of an indoor
                    volleyball court is the same as an outdoor court. <br><br>Volleyball courts are regulated at 59’ (18
                    m) in length with a width of 29.5' (9 m). Attack lines dividing the front and back rows are marked
                    9’10” (3 m) parallel to the net. Free zones at a minimum of 9’10” (3 m) are required around the
                    entirety of the court with generous clearances up to 16’5” (5 m) on the sides and 21’4” (6.5 m) in
                    the back.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Ball-</span>An indoor volleyball court is 18 meters long by 9
                    meters wide (59 feet by 29 feet, 6 inches), 9x9m (29'6" x 29'6") on each side of the net. According
                    to FIVB rules, there must be 3m (9'10") of free space on all sides of the court.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How To Play-</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>A volleyball game consists of two teams of six players each, separated by a net. The six
                        volleyball court positions are setter, middle blocker, outside hitter, opposite hitter, libero
                        and serving specialist.</li>
                    <li>To start, flip a coin to determine which team serves the ball first.</li>
                    <li>Then the two teams will rally—or hit the ball back and forth over the net—until a fault occurs.
                        There is a maximum of three hits per side.</li>
                    <li>The objective is to score points by sending the ball over the net, grounding it into the
                        opponent’s court.</li>
                    <li>Volleyball matches are made up of sets, typically three or five sets.</li>
                    <li>Three-set matches are two sets to 25 points and a third set to 15 points. Each set must be won
                        by two points. The first team to win two sets is the winner of the match</li>
                    <li>Five-set matches are four sets to 25 points and a fifth set to 15 points. The team must win by
                        two points unless tournament rules dictate otherwise. The first team to win three sets is the
                        winner.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Match Rules-</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only 6 players on the floor at any given time: 3 in the front row and 3 in the back row.</li>
                    <li>Points are made on every serve for the winning team of the rally (rally-point scoring).</li>
                    <li>Players may not hit the ball twice in succession (a block is not considered a hit).</li>
                    <li>Ball may be played off the net during a volley and on a serve.</li>
                    <li>A ball hitting a boundary line is in.</li>
                    <li>A ball is out if it hits an antennae, the floor completely outside the court, any of the net or
                        cables outside the antennae, the referee stand or pole, or the ceiling above a non-playable area
                    </li>
                    <li>It is legal to contact the ball with any part of a player’s body.</li>
                    <li>It is illegal to catch, hold or throw the ball</li>
                    <li>A player cannot block or attack a serve from on or inside the 10-foot line.</li>
                    <li>After the serve, front-line players may switch positions at the net.</li>
                    <li>Matches are made up of sets; the number depends on level of play.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rule Violations-</span>
                <p>Committing any of these volleyball rule violations results in a point for the opponent.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stepping on or across the service line when serving while making contact with the ball.</li>
                    <li>Failure to serve the ball over the net successfully.</li>
                    <li>Ball-handling errors and contacting the ball illegally (double touching, lifting, carrying,
                        throwing, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Touching the net with any part of the body while the ball is in play.</li>
                    <li>Blocking a ball coming from the opponent’s court and contacting the ball when reaching over the
                        net if your opponent has not used 3 contacts AND has a player there to make a play on the ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>Attacking a ball coming from the opponent’s court and contacting the ball when reaching over the
                        net when the ball has not yet broken the vertical plane of the net.</li>
                    <li>Crossing the court centerline with any part of your body, with the exception of a hand or foot.
                        It is only considered a violation if the entire hand or entire foot crosses the court
                        centerline.</li>
                    <li>Serving out of rotation or out of order.</li>
                    <li>Back row player blocking (deflecting a ball coming from the opponent) when, at the moment of
                        contact, the back row player is near the net and has part of their body above the top of the
                        net. This is an illegal block.</li>
                    <li>Back row player attacking a ball inside the front zone (the area inside the 3M/10-foot line)
                        when, at the moment of contact, the ball is completely above the net. This is an illegal attack
                    </li>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Volleyball Referee Rules and Regulations-</span>
                <p>Only the first and second referees are allowed to blow whistles during a match. The first referee may
                    give the scorer the option to use an audible device to notify the volleyball referees of "out of
                    rotation" faults.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first referee gives the signal for service to begin the rally.</li>
                    <li>The first and second referees signal the end of rally, provided a fault has been committed and
                        they have identified its nature.</li>
                    <li>The referees may blow the whistle when the ball is out of play to indicate they authorize or
                        reject a team request.</li>
                    <li>Immediately after a referees whistle to signal the end of rally, they have to indicate with the
                        official volleyball hand signals...
                        If the fault is whistle by the first referee, he/she indicates...
                        the team to serve
                        the nature of the fault
                        the player at fault
                        The second referee will follow the first referee hand signals by mimicking them.
                        If the fault is whistle by the second referee, he/she indicates...
                        the nature of the fault
                        the player at fault
                        the team to serve following the hand signal of first referee
                        The first referee doesn't show the fault and nature of the fault, but only the team to serve.
                        In the case of a double fault, both referees indicate...
                        the nature of the fault
                        the player at fault
                        the team to serve, with the signal lead by the first referee</li>

                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration Of The Match-</span>Since the match can last for either two
                    or three sets, there is no set time limit for this particular type of game. Generally, a single
                    volleyball set will last anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes, so a best 2-of-3 match can be expected to
                    last from 60 to 90 minutes.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting and Restarting Play-</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play is started when the right back (the person on the right of the second row) of the serving
                        team steps outside his end line into the serving area and bats the ball with a hand, fist, or
                        arm over the net into the opponents' half of the court</li>
                    <li>In order to restart the game after a ball has gone out of play the ball is kicked back into play
                        from the touchline and from corners. The ball must be placed stationary on the touchline and the
                        feet of the player taking the kick-in must not cross the line.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ball In and Out Play-</span> A ball hitting a boundary line is in. A
                    ball is out if it hits an antennae, the floor completely outside the court, any of the net or cables
                    outside the antennae, the referee stand or pole, or the ceiling above a non-playable area</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offensive Strategies-</span><br><br> In volleyball, offensive
                    strategies refer to an action plan to score a point. This is done by creating a play that causes the
                    ball to land on the other team’s side of the court. Defensive strategies are a reaction to offensive
                    plays. These include blocking or digging. <br><br> A basic volleyball strategy for an offense is a
                    6-2. In this type of play, the player in the right front position is the setter. Whoever is in this
                    position after a rotation automatically becomes the setter. For this type of strategy, it is
                    important to have more than just one good setter in the team. An advantage of this is that everyone
                    on the team hones their setting skills. You also just need to practice a few sets to create an
                    offensive play from this position. A downside, however, is that it can get predictable for the other
                    team. <br><br> Another well-known offensive play is the 5-1. In this play, there is one designated
                    setter and five hitters. The upside is that the team knows who to look to for direction (setter) and
                    there is consistency in each set. A disadvantage is that the opposing team can target your setter if
                    the player is small. <br><br> When it comes to defense, the player should be between the ball’s
                    trajectory and the half-court. The goal is to block or dig, and then convert the contact into an
                    offensive opportunity for the team.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Defensive Strategies-</span>
                <p>Here are some other things to keep in mind as a defender.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your focus should be on ensuring the ball does not hit the floor. You should always follow the
                        ball with your eyes. Your mentality should be that every ball is coming towards you.</li>
                    <li>Backcourt players should always be ready in the correct defensive position. This means medium to
                        low body position, body forward and backside down. The latter is important so that when the
                        player contacts the ball, they come up and not go down with it.</li>
                    <li>Reading is a crucial aspect of any defense play. Getting into the correct position even before
                        contact increases the chances of a successful block or dig.</li>
                    <li>Lunging, sprawling, or diving should be a last option. It is important to be aggressive but
                        remain in control.</li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fouls-</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>A foul is a failure to play as permitted by the rules.</li>
                    <li>A double foul occurs when opposing players commit rule violations at the same time.</li>
                    <li>A double hit occurs when a player’s successive or multiple contacts are illegal.</li>
                    <li>A foot fault occurs when a player violates the serving area or centerline restrictions.</li>
                    <li>PENALTIES FOR FOULS: For a single foul (double hit, foot fault, etc.) point and side out is
                        awarded to the opponent. For a double foul during a live ball play, a replay is called. For a
                        double foul during a dead ball, the penalty is assessed to both teams, with both teams rotating.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replay-</span>
                <p>A replay is the act of putting the ball in play without awarding a point or side out or rotating for
                    the serve. A replay is awarded when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An official’s mistaken whistle interrupts play.</li>
                    <li>A player unintentionally serves prior to the referee’s signal to serve.
                        If this happens twice, the serve will be awarded to the other team.</li>
                    <li>There is a double foul during a live ball.</li>
                    <li>There are conflicting calls which the referee cannot resolve.</li>
                    <li>A player’s legitimate effort to play the ball is affected by a non-player in a playable area or
                        by the ball becoming motionless in the net inside the net antennas or on an overhead obstruction
                        over a playable area.</li>
                    <li>Play is interrupted because a foreign object enters the proximity of the playing area, or a
                        player is injured.</li>
                    <li>The ball contacts a backboard or its supports hanging in a vertical position over a playable
                        area and in the judgment of the official the ball would have remained in play had the backboard
                        not been there.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Early Years-</span><br>The sport of volleyball originated in
                        the United States, and is now just beginning to achieve the type of popularity in the U.S. that
                        it has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation
                        sports.In 1895, William G. Morgan, an instructor at the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA)
                        in Holyoke, Mass., decided to blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to
                        create a game for his classes of businessmen which would demand less physical contact than
                        basketball. He created the game of Volleyball (at that time called mintonette).Per Morgan, the
                        game was fit for the gymnasium or exercise hall but, could also be played outdoor. The play
                        consisted of any number of players keeping a ball in motion from one side to the other over a
                        net raised 6 feet 6 inches above the floor. Play is started by a player on one side serving the
                        ball over the net into the opponents’ field or court. The opponents then, without letting the
                        ball strike the floor, return it, and it is in this way kept going back and forth until one side
                        fails to return the ball or the ball hits the floor. The side serving the ball earns points when
                        the opposite side either fails to return the ball or allows the ball to hit the floor.During a
                        demonstration game, someone remarked to Morgan that the players seemed to be volleying the ball
                        back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball” would be a more descriptive name for the
                        sport.After reaching Japan and Asia through the YMCA network by 1896, a specially designed ball
                        came to be by 1900, and over the next 20 years, rules were set into place. The Philippines
                        created the “set” and “spike” in 1916 and six-a-side play was the standard two years later. By
                        1920, the rules mandating three hits per side and back-row attacks were institutedJapan, Russia
                        and the United States each started national volleyball associations during the 1920s. And when
                        U.S. soldiers brought the game overseas during World War II, the sport spread through the rest
                        of Europe like wildfire. Shortly after, France recognized the sport nationally as well. The
                        International Olympic Committee (IOC) made the game a non-Olympic sport in 1949 and the first
                        World Championships for men were held in that same year. The women’s first world-level
                        competition came three years laterThe Russians would dominate the sport until the mid-1980s with
                        some challenge from Japan during the stint. The United States finally made their mark as the
                        men’s team won back-to-back gold medals in Los Angeles (1984) and Seoul (1988)With beach
                        volleyball stealing some of the spotlight away from indoor, certain traditions were dropped for
                        the Sydney Games. Replacing the previous system where only the serving team could earn one, a
                        point will be at stake for every rally. In addition, another agile defender called a “libero,”
                        who is free to substitute in back-row defense at almost every turn was added.Today there are
                        more than 46 million Americans who play volleyball. Worldwide, there are over 800 million people
                        who play volleyball at least once a weekIn the mid 1960’s, the United States Junior Olympic
                        Volleyball (USJOV) program was established. Initial talks to establish a junior program within
                        the United States Volleyball Association (USVBA) were not productive. The USVBA, then comprised
                        totally of volunteers and lacking paid staff members, was required to concentrate on its Open
                        Club program. In addition, priority efforts beyond that were to develop the national teams and
                        international competition program. The USVBA Executive Committee granted permission to the
                        Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) to pursue the development of a full-scale junior development
                        program within the AAU structureFollowing two years of discussion and negotiations, and the
                        finalization of appropriate legislation, the AAU approved volleyball as a Junior Olympic sport.
                        John Eaton of Virginia Beach, V.A., was appointed to write the first set of rules for Junior
                        Olympic Volleyball. Using the rules of volleyball as approved by the USVBA, Eaton modified the
                        rules so that they would be more compatible to the age group program. These rules still serve as
                        the basic foundation of junior volleyball in the United States today.Although the National AAU
                        approved volleyball as a “JO” sport, the organization did not include it in the multi-sport
                        Junior Olympic Championship. Volleyball had to strike out on its own for qualifying national
                        tournament sites. The first national championship was conducted in 1974 at the Catonsville
                        Community College in Catonsville, MD.Although the bulk of the teams were from East of the
                        Mississippi River, the tournament was qualified a success due to the number of teams entered;
                        the enthusiasm it generated; and the interest that was stimulated. In this tournament, 200
                        athletes (not teams) took part, as age group teams from Chicago and such places as York and
                        Haverford, PA., emerged as national champions.The 1974 national tournament followed two years of
                        experimentation with a “Prep School-East” and a “Prep School-West” national championship
                        approach. The next logical approach was the implementation of developmental programs in the 57
                        local AAU associations. Although some developed programs, most notably Chicago, Louisiana and
                        eastern Pennsylvania, other local associations did not. As a result, AAU Junior Olympic
                        Volleyball efforts were, for the most part, limited to the national tournament In some local AAU
                        associations, volleyball was not even a recognized committee, Junior Olympic or otherwise.Once
                        the USVBA established the national teams/international competition program, efforts were turned
                        toward the programs of junior development. Since the AAU had fulfilled only a portion of its
                        earlier commitments, administrative efforts were directed toward grass roots development. In
                        1978, an exploratory meeting was held with representatives of various organizations in Kansas
                        City, which included the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Association
                        of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA),
                        Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA). From this
                        meeting, emerged an action plan to negotiate an agreement with the AAU to coordinate a
                        development plan to complement the national AAU/JOV tournament. This event had realized great
                        success and was now situated in its permanent site of Lisle, Illinois.The action plan, however,
                        was never realized because of the National Amateur Act and the eventual birth of the USVBA’s
                        National Junior Championship. [The Amateur Sports Act (Public Law 95-606) was adopted in 1978.
                        This law was amended in 1998 to become the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act (OASA). Because of the
                        efforts of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska to shepherd this law through Congress, the 1998
                        amendments are often called the “Ted Stevens Amendments.” The original Amateur Sports Act, as
                        adopted in 1978, required the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) “to encourage and provide
                        assistance to amateur athletic programs and competition for handicapped individuals, including,
                        where feasible, the expansion of meaningful participation by handicapped individuals in programs
                        of athletic competition for able-bodied individuals.”] It was now evident that one tournament of
                        this quality and level was not enough to accommodate the number of junior teams interested. The
                        event was modeled after the actual Olympic games, complete with a parade of states and opening
                        ceremonies. Shortly after a comprehensive concept, as well as a full-fledged grass roots action
                        plan for Junior Olympic Volleyball development, was developed. The plan was to be implemented by
                        the USVBA regions and fed into the USJOV national tournament structure. It was created to serve
                        as a major building block for the scholastic, collegiate, recreation and club play throughout
                        the country and was designed to be the future of volleyball in the United States.In 1984, the
                        USVBA Board of Directors pledged its priority to the development of this program and reinforced
                        their statement with staff efforts. In 1985, the USVBA hired the nation’s first full-time
                        administrator of Junior Olympic and Youth Volleyball.USA Volleyball, acting as a National
                        Governing Body for volleyball in the United States, established a Junior Olympic Volleyball
                        Division. It is comprised of special interest representatives, but more importantly, with
                        persons who are highly regarded and respected as leaders in the development of junior volleyball
                        in the USA. They come from the scholastic, collegiate and club ranks and have an in-depth
                        background in volleyball. Junior Olympic Volleyball is now a viable force within the volleyball
                        community. It is fully expected to establish volleyball as a primary recreation sport and an
                        important collegiate and scholastic activity, and equally important, establish United States as
                        a major force in international competition in the future.Northern California has had a long
                        history of volleyball activity. In the early years, volleyball competition was centered
                        primarily in the YMCA’s. The San Francisco YMCA was the first Northern California team to
                        achieve national prominence by winning the National AAU Championship in 1929. The Embarcadero
                        YMCA hosted the USVBA National Open Championships in 1939, and the following year finished
                        second in the YMCA Championship. In 1974, Tom Cotter was instrumental in developing the first
                        Far Western Championship Tournament. The following year, Tom was appointed as the first
                        commissioner (regional representative) of the newly- formed Region 12 encompassing Northern
                        California, Nevada, and UtahDuring the 1950’s Stockton YMCA became a national power under coach
                        Harold W. Peterson, winning the Open in 1954 and 1955 and finishing second in 1952, ’56, ’57,
                        and ’63. Bob Miller and Hal Durham each had brief stints as Commissioner in the early 1950’s and
                        Len Gibson was appointed in 1954. The exact dates are somewhat hazy in the Region
                        record.Although there is mention of women’s competition earlier, the first recorded Women’s
                        Region 12 Championship took place in 1965 due largely to the efforts of Women’s Representative
                        Jerry Kaluna and the Women’s Association founder Fran Plunket. The year women first competed in
                        the Far Western was 1968, the year Al Monaco became Region CommissionerIn 1971 the Region
                        Executive Committee was formed to help Al with the ever-increasing tasks of running a
                        fast-growing region. In 1972, Nevada and Utah joined Idaho to form Region 14, leaving Northern
                        California as a separate region. The same year, Dan Gellerman published the first issue of the
                        Region 12 news, and the first Region 12 volleyball camp was held at St Mary’s College.In 1973 Al
                        Monaco was hired as Executive Director of the USVBA and Lon Crosson took over as Commissioner.
                        Gary Colberg, the present Commissioner, succeeded Lon in 1975The rules of volleyball have
                        changed many times since William Morgan first developed the game in 1895 with an original
                        purpose of providing some form of recreation and relaxation for businessmen at the Holyoke, MA
                        Y.M.C.A.The first rules, written by Mr. Morgan in long hand, contained the following basic
                        features: The net was 6 feet, 6 inches high. The court was 25 X 50 feet Any number of
                        participants was allowed. The length of the game was nine innings, with three outs allowed per
                        team per inning. Continuous air dribbling of the ball was permissible up to a restraining line 4
                        feet from the net. No limit on the number of hits on each side of the court. A served ball could
                        be assisted across the net. A second serve (as in tennis) was permitted if the first resulted in
                        a fault. Any ball hitting the net, except on the first service, was a fault and resulted in side
                        out.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of
                        volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the
                        FIVB after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition
                        involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in Prague,
                        Czechoslovakia. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe. <br> Three years
                        later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year
                        cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from South, Central and North America.
                        <br> Since volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced
                        in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with
                        the Summer Olympic Games. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and
                        the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was
                        achieved. <br> The number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the
                        years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the
                        1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24
                        after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by
                        the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the Olympic Games. <br> Until 1974, the
                        host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single
                        exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice
                        has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was
                        held, as the former was, in Japan.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Golf</span> is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various
                    clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.</p>
                <p>Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with
                    the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically
                    have 18 or 9 holes, although they may have another number of holes. Each hole on the course must
                    contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup. There
                    are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), various
                    hazards (water, rocks, bunkers) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest
                    score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match
                    play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite
                    level.</p>
                <p>The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old
                    Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is
                    The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the
                    Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's
                    professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open,
                    and the PGA Championship.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">STRATEGY AND GAMEPLAY</h3>
                <P>Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A "round" typically
                    consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. Each hole is
                    played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes. The game can be played by any number of
                    people, although a typical group playing will have 1–4 people playing the round. The typical amount
                    of time required for pace of play for a 9-hole round is two hours and four hours for an 18-hole
                    round.</P>
                <P>Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club
                    on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole,
                    it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. A tee
                    is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few
                    centimetres high. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including
                    plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were
                    provided for the purpose. A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce
                    litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground. Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or
                    grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit, and also places the ball in the
                    very centre of the striking face of the club (the "sweet spot") for better distance.</P>
                <p>When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance, typically more than 225
                    yards (210 m), the shot is commonly called a "drive" and is generally made with a long-shafted,
                    large-headed wood club called a "driver". Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs, such as
                    higher-numbered woods or irons. Once the ball comes to rest, the golfer strikes it again as many
                    times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a "lay-up", an "approach", a "pitch", or
                    a "chip", until the ball reaches the green, where he or she then "putts" the ball into the hole
                    (commonly called "sinking the putt" or "holing out"). The goal of getting the ball into the hole
                    ("holing" the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of
                    longer grass called "rough" (usually found alongside fairways), which both slows any ball that
                    contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; "doglegs", which are
                    changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them;
                    bunkers (or sand traps); and water hazards such as ponds or streams.</p>
                <p>In stroke play competitions played according to strict rules, each player plays their ball until it
                    is holed no matter how many strokes that may take. In match play it is acceptable to simply pick up
                    one's ball and "surrender the hole" after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is
                    mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. It is also acceptable in informal stroke
                    play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the "par" rating of the hole (a
                    "triple bogey" – see below); while technically a violation of Rule 3–2, this practice speeds play as
                    a courtesy to others, and avoids "runaway scores" and excessive frustration.</p>
                <p>The total distance from the first teeing ground to the 18th green can be quite long; total yardages
                    "through the green" can be in excess of 7,000 yards (6.4 km), and when adding in the travel distance
                    between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, even skilled players may easily travel five
                    miles (8 km) or more during a round. At some courses, electric golf carts are used to travel between
                    shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round.
                    On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap
                    or using a "golf trolley" for their bag. These trolleys may or may not be battery assisted. At many
                    amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to
                    carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level
                    private clubs, players may be accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment
                    and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course.</p>

                    2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf
                    Association (USGA).With the aim of simplifying the rules, in 2017 the USGA and R&A undertook a
                    complete rewrite. The new rule book came into effect in January 2019.</p>
                <p>There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers. Essentially, anybody who has
                    ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not
                    considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However,
                    amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash
                    prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.</p>
                <p>In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf
                    etiquette. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's
                    obligation to contribute to the care of the course. Though there are no penalties for breach of
                    etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve
                    everyone's playing experience.</p>
                <h4>Penalities</h4>
                <p>Penalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a player's score as if
                    there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Either one or two strokes are added for most rule infractions
                    or for taking relief from various situations, with the "general penalty" defined as two-strokes, and
                    disqualification for severe or repeated rule breaches. Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds (OB) results in a penalty of one stroke and distance
                        (Rule 18.2).</li>
                    <li>With the exception of certain circumstances, a one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player causes
                        their ball to move</li>
                    <li>A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player elects to take relief when their ball comes to rest
                        within a red or yellow penalty area (Rule 17), or from an unplayable lie (Rule 19).</li>
                    <li>A two-stroke penalty is incurred for making a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 6.3c).</li>
                    <li>A two-stroke penalty is incurred for hitting a fellow player's ball if both balls lay on the
                        green prior to the stroke (Rule 11.1a).</li>
                    <li>Disqualification can result from cheating, signing for a lower score, or failing to adhere to
                        one or more rules that lead to improper play.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are
                    unclear and much debated.</p>
                <p>Some historians trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent
                    stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as
                    the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into
                    the modern game.</p>
                <p>Others cite chuiwan (捶丸; "chui" means striking and "wan" means small ball) as the progenitor, a
                    Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries.A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist
                    Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled "The Autumn Banquet" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial
                    court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a
                    hole. The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France.
                    The Persian game chowkan is another possible ancient origin, albeit being more polo-like. In
                    addition, kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen,
                    Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V, a year
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>The modern game originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning
                    of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. James IV lifted the ban in
                    1502 when he became a golfer himself, with golf clubs first recorded in 1503–1504: "For golf clubbes
                    and balles to the King that he playit with". To many golfers, the Old Course at St Andrews, a links
                    course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard
                    18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18
                    holes.Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links, East Lothian, Scotland as early as 2
                    March 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records. The
                    oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers,
                    later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which was played at Leith, Scotland. he
                    world's oldest golf tournament in existence, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which
                    was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish
                    golfers winning the earliest majors. Two Scotsmen from Dunfermline, John Reid and Robert Lockhart,
                    first demonstrated golf in the U.S. by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888, with Reid setting up
                    America's first golf club the same year, Saint Andrew's Golf Club in Yonkers, New York.</p>

                <p>The major championships are the four most prestigious men's tournaments of the year. In chronological
                    order they are: The Masters, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship (referred to in North America as
                    the British Open) and the PGA Championship.</p>
                <p>The fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world. The
                    Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, since its inception in
                    1934. It is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year. The U.S. Open
                    and PGA Championship are played at courses around the United States, while the Open Championship is
                    played at courses around the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Prior to the advent of the PGA Championship and The Masters, the four Majors were the U.S. Open, the
                    U.S. Amateur, the Open Championship, and the British Amateur.</p>

                <h4>World's Longest Hole</h4>
                <p>The longest hole in the world can be found in Sano, Japan at Satsuki GC. It’s a par 7, 7th, and it
                    measures a whopping 964 yards. Imagine trying to accomplish that in only three swings. Hey, maybe
                    this will even give you an excuse to take a Japanese holiday. You never know, you might come back
                    with a new golfing record of your own.</p>
                <h4>The Fastest Round</h4>
                <p>The fastest round ever was completed in 13 minutes and 42 seconds. To make this record happen, a team
                    of 80 golfers were placed around the 18-hole course, all doing their part to make the time. The
                    record was achieved at Farnham Golf Club in Surrey. How 80 people were convinced to chip in on this
                    golf round is a bit confusing to me, but their team work certainly paid off.</p>
                <h4>World Number One</h4>
                <p>Tiger holds the record for most weeks as world number one at 683, as well as most consecutive weeks,
                    281. That means he has been ranked the best golfer in the world for over 12 years in total, and
                    spent the whole year as World No.1 eight times - 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.
                </p>
                <h4>Youngest Grand Slam Winner</h4>
                <p>Tiger became the youngest player to win a career Grand Slam of The Masters, the PGA Championship, the
                    US Open and the Open Championship when he won the 2000 Open aged just 24. Woods joined Gene Sarazan,
                    Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus in completing the career Grand Slam.</p>

                        players, played on a chequered board on which each playing piece is moved according to precise
                        rules. The object is to put the opponent's king under a direct attack from which escape is
                        impossible It is sometimes called Western chess or international chess to distinguish it from
                        related games, such as xiangqi and shogi. The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the
                        rest
                        of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a
                        similar but much older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular
                        games,
                        played by millions of people worldwide</p>
                    <p>The reality of chess is different – it actually is an incredibly beneficial pastime, because
                        playing

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Movement</span>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Basic move</span>
                    <br>There are 6 unique chess pieces
                    Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except
                    when
                    capturing an opponent's piece.

                    Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is
                    captured (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square except in the case of en
                    passant. The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.[3] The king can be put in
                    check but cannot be captured (see below)
                </p>


                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">King-</span>The king moves exactly one square horizontally,
                    vertically,
                    or diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per
                    game
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rook-</span> A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally
                    or
                    vertically. It also is moved when castling.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bishop-</span> A bishop moves any number of vacant squares
                    diagonally
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quen- </span>The queen moves any number of vacant squares
                    horizontally,
                    vertically, or diagonally.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Knight- </span>A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on
                    the
                    same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one
                    square
                    vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an "L" pattern.)
                    The
                    knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pawns- </span>
                    Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
                    A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn
                    also
                    has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns
                    cannot
                    move backwards.
                    A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy
                    piece
                    on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those squares when
                    vacant except when capturing en passant</p>

                    "White"; the player controlling the black pieces is named "Black". White moves first, then players
                    alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move
                    is
                    detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or a draw is declared, as
                    explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a time control, a player who exceeds
                    the
                    time limit loses the game unless they cannot be checkmated.

                    The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this
                    decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or round-robin
                    tournament) or, in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of
                    random
                    choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of
                    each
                    color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open and receives the color of the piece
                    that
                    is reaveled.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Checks-</span><br>
                <p>A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move
                    because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver
                    check to the opposing player.

                    It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways to get out
                    of check are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Move the king to a square where it is not in check.
                    </li>
                    <li>Capture the checking piece (possibly with the king).</li>
                    <li>Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece
                    </li>
                </ul>
                If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the game is over .

                In informal games, it is customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's
                king in check. However, in formal competitions, check is rarely announced.</p>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Illegal move in Blitz-</span>In Blitz chess, if a player completes
                    an
                    illegal move, the player's opponent may claim a win before making a move (if the opponent has enough
                    material to win). One way to claim this win is to take a King left in check by the opponent. Once
                    the
                    illegal move has been answered, the move stands..</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Draws-</span><br>
                    The game ends in a draw if any of these conditions occur
                <ul>
                    <li>The player to move is not in check and has no legal move. This situation is called a stalemate.
                        An example of such a position is shown in the adjacent diagram.</li>
                    <li>The game reaches a dead position.</li>
                    <li>Both players agree to a draw after one of the players makes such an offer</li>
                    <li>The player having the move claims a draw by correctly declaring that one of the following
                        conditions exists, or by correctly declaring an intention to make a move which will bring about
                        one of these conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                At one time, if a player was able to check the opposing king continually (perpetual check) and the
                player indicated their intention to do so, the game was drawn. This rule is no longer in effect;
                however, players will usually agree to a draw in such a situation, since either the rule on threefold
                repetition or the fifty-move rule will eventually be applicable
                </p>The movement of pieces is to be done with one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving
                it,
                the move cannot be retracted unless the move is illegal.[30] As for the touch-move rule, an arbiter who
                observes a violation of this rule must intervene immediately.[31] A player must claim a violation of the
                rule immediately before making a move, or lose the right to claim.[32]

                When castling, a player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same
                hand.[33]

                In the case of a promotion, if a player releases the pawn on the eighth rank, the player must promote
                the
                pawn. After the pawn has moved, the player may touch any piece not on the board and the promotion is not
                finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Competition Rules-</span>The following rules are the rules used for
                    "over the board" (OTB) games. They are defined by the FIDE Laws of Chess.[5] The FIDE Laws of Chess
                    define the rules for Standard chess, Rapid chess, Blitz chess and guidelines for Chess960. For
                    Standard
                    chess, the players must record the moves, which is optional in Rapid chess and Blitz Chess.[29] Some
                    rules are specifically adapted for disabled players. As the rules cover OTB play, they cannot be
                    directly applied to computer chess or online chess, played on a computer device. The rules for
                    correspondence chess are defined by the ICCF. </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Moving the pieces-</span><br>The movement of pieces is to be done
                    with
                    one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it, the move cannot be retracted unless
                    the
                    move is illegal. As for the touch-move rule, an arbiter who observes a violation of this rule must
                    intervene immediately.[31] A player must claim a violation of the rule immediately before making a
                    move,
                    or lose the right to claim.

                    When castling, a player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the
                    same
                    hand.

                    In the case of a promotion, if a player releases the pawn on the eighth rank, the player must
                    promote
                    the pawn. After the pawn has moved, the player may touch any piece not on the board and the
                    promotion is
                    not finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square.
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timing-</span>Tournament games are played under time constraints,
                    called time controls, using a chess clock. Each player is timed separately and must make moves
                    within the time control or forfeit the game. There are different types of time controls applied. For
                    standard chess, different periods can be defined with different fixed times (e.g. first 40 moves in
                    100 minutes, next 20 moves in 50 minutes, remaining moves in 15 minutes). For rapid and blitz chess,
                    only one period can be defined where all moves must be performed. Additionally, an increment or
                    delay per move may be defined.
                <ul>
                    <li>When a player runs out of time, this event is called flag fall. A flag fall has no
                        consequences unless stated as observed by the arbiter, in which case the arbiter must
                        intervene,or claimed by a player.</li>
                    <li>When no flag fall is stated, and one of the following events occur, the result of the game
                        still holds. It is of no relevance if the player runs out of time afterwards, or has already
                        run out of time, but this was not stated</li>
                    <li>If a player delivers a checkmate, the game is over and that player wins.</li>
                    <li>If a move results in a stalemate, dead position, fivefold repetition or the
                        seventy-five-move rule applies, the game is over and the game is drawn. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY OF CHESS</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Early Years-</span>The history of chess can be traced back
                    nearly
                    1500 years to its earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the
                    subject
                    of speculation. From India it spread to Persia. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia,
                    chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Spain and the rest of Southern
                    Europe.
                    The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE<br>


                    Precursors to chess originated in India. There, its early form in the 7th century CE was known as
                    chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), which translates to "four divisions (of the military)": infantry,
                    cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry. These forms are represented by the pieces that would evolve into
                    the
                    modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.

                    Chess was introduced to Persia from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of
                    Persian nobilit Around 600 CE in Sassanid Persia, the name for the game became chatrang (Persian:
                    چترنگ), which subsequently evolved to shatranj (Arabic: شطرنج; Persian: شترنج) after the conquest of
                    Persia by the Rashidun Caliphate, due to the lack of native ch and ng sounds in the Arabic language.
                    The
                    rules were developed further during this time; players started calling "Shāh!" (Persian for "King!")
                    when attacking the opponent's king, and "Shāh Māt!" (Persian for "the king is helpless" – see
                    checkmate)
                    when the king was attacked and could not escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess
                    as it
                    traveled to other lands.
                    <br>
                    The earliest precursor of modern chess is a game called chaturanga, which flourished in India by the
                    6th
                    century, and is the earliest known game to have two essential features found in all later chess
                    variations—different pieces having different powers (which was not the case with checkers and Go),
                    and
                    victory depending on the fate of one piece, the king of modern chess. A common theory is that
                    India's
                    development of the board, and chess, was likely due to India's mathematical enlightenment involving
                    the
                    creation of the number zero.Other game pieces (speculatively called "chess pieces") uncovered in
                    archaeological findings are considered as coming from other, distantly related board games, which
                    may
                    have had boards of 100 squares or more.[non-tertiary source needed]

                    Chess was designed for an ashtāpada (Sanskrit for "having eight feet", i.e. an 8×8 squared board),
                    which
                    may have been used earlier for a backgammon-type race game (perhaps related to a dice-driven race
                    game
                    still played in south India where the track starts at the middle of a side and spirals into the
                    center).
                    Ashtāpada, the uncheckered 8×8 board served as the main board for playing chaturanga.Other Indian
                    boards
                    included the 10×10 Dasapada and the 9×9 Saturankam.Traditional Indian chessboards often have X
                    markings
                    on some or all of squares a1 a4 a5 a8 d1 d4 d5 d8 e1 e4 e5 e8 h1 h4 h5 h8: these may have been "safe
                    squares" where capturing was not allowed in a dice-driven backgammon-type race game played on the
                    ashtāpada before chess was invented.

                    The Cox-Forbes theory, proposed in the late 18th century by Hiram Cox, and later developed by Duncan
                    Forbes, asserted that the four-handed game chaturaji was the original form of chaturanga. The theory
                    is
                    no longer considered tenable.

                    In Sanskrit, the word chaturaṅga literally means "having four limbs (or parts)" and in epic poetry
                    often
                    means "army" (the four parts are elephants, chariots, horsemen, foot soldiers). The name came from a
                    battle formation mentioned in the Indian epic Mahabharata. The game chaturanga was a
                    battle-simulation
                    game which rendered Indian military strategy of the time.

                    Some people formerly played chess using a die to decide which piece to move. There was an unproven
                    theory that chess started as this dice-chess and that the gambling and dice aspects of the game were
                    removed because of Hindu religious objections

                    Scholars in areas to which the game subsequently spread, for example the Arab Abu al-Hasan 'Alī
                    al-Mas'ūdī, detailed the Indian use of chess as a tool for military strategy, mathematics, gambling
                    and
                    even its vague association with astronomy. Mas'ūdī notes that ivory in India was chiefly used for
                    the
                    production of chess and backgammon pieces, and asserts that the game was introduced to Persia from
                    India, along with the book Kelileh va Demneh, during the reign of emperor Nushirwan.

                    In some variants, a win was by checkmate, or by stalemate, or by "bare king" (taking all of an
                    opponent's pieces except the king).

                    In some parts of India the pieces in the places of the rook, knight and bishop were renamed by words
                    meaning (in this order) Boat, Horse, and Elephant, or Elephant, Horse, and Camel, but keeping the
                    same
                    moves.

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">WORLD CHESS CHAMPIONSHIPS</h3>
                <p>The World Chess Championship is played to determine the world champion in chess. The current world
                    champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway, who has held the title since 2013.</p>
                <p>The first event generally recognized as a world championship was the 1886 match between the two
                    leading players in the world, Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort. Steinitz won, becoming the
                    first world champion. From 1886 to 1946, the champion set the terms, requiring any challenger to
                    raise a sizable stake and defeat the champion in a match in order to become the new world champion.
                    Following the death of reigning world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, FIDE (the International
                    Chess Federation) took over administration of the World Championship, beginning with the 1948 World
                    Championship tournament. From 1948 to 1993, FIDE organized a set of tournaments to choose a new
                    challenger every three years. In 1993, reigning champion Garry Kasparov broke away from FIDE, which
                    led to a rival claimant to the title of World Champion for the next thirteen years. The titles were
                    unified at the World Chess Championship 2006, and all subsequent matches have once again been
                    administered by FIDE.</p>
                <p>Since 2014, the championship has settled on a two-year cycle, although the 2020 match was postponed
                    to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the next match will be held in 2023. Magnus Carlsen has
                    been world champion since he defeated Viswanathan Anand in 2013. He successfully defended the title
                    in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021. In 2022, he announced that he would not defend his title a fifth
                    time, and so the 2023 championship will be played between the top two finishers of the qualifying
                    2022 Candidates Tournament instead: Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Ding Liren of China.</p>
                <p>Though the world championship is open to all players, there are separate championships for women,
                    under-20s and lower age groups, and seniors; as well as one for computers. There are also chess
                    world championships in rapid, blitz, correspondence, problem solving, and Fischer Random Chess.</p>

                    <p class="px-2 pt-2">In the title run that ultimately culminated in his match with Boris Spassky,
                        Bobby Fischer won a remarkable 20 games against elite competition. He began his run in the Palma
                        de Mallorca Interzonal of 1970 where he won seven games in a row to finish the tournament.
                        Because Oscar Panno forfeited his game, some chess historians choose to discount this game.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">In the Candidates' matches that followed in 1971, Fischer defeated both Mark
                        Taimanov and Bent Larsen with perfect 6-0 scores. An initial win in the next match against
                        Tigran Petrosian was followed by a loss in game two, ending the streak.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">Fischer went on to handily defeat both Petrosian and Boris Spassky to become world
                        chess champion.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Billiards</span> <br> billiards, any of various games played on a
                    rectangular table with a designated number of small balls and a long stick called a cue. The table
                    and the cushioned rail bordering the table are topped with a feltlike tight-fitting cloth. Carom, or
                    French, billiards is played with three balls on a table that has no pockets. The other principal
                    games are played on tables that have six pockets, one at each corner and one in each of the long
                    sides; these games include English billiards, played with three balls; snooker, played with 21 balls
                    and a cue ball; and pocket billiards, or pool, played with 15 balls and a cue ball. There are
                    numerous varieties of each game—particularly of carom and pocket billiards. <br> Many
                    countries—among them France, England, China, Italy, and Spain—have been credited with the invention
                    of the game, but, in fact, nothing is really known about the origin of billiards. It may be inferred
                    that it developed from a variety of games in which propelling a ball was a main feature. The
                    earliest references to the game in Europe occur in the 15th century. <br> All billiards games
                    require the basic equipment of a table, cue sticks, and balls. The traditional mahogany billiards
                    table is still in use, but tables are now generally made of other woods and synthetic materials. The
                    large rectangular table typically is twice as long as it is wide. It has a bed usually of polished
                    slate covered by a woven woolen cloth, sometimes referred to as felt. Angled rails of hardened
                    rubber or synthetic rubber, known as cushions, rim the inner edge of the table. The cue is a tapered
                    rod of polished wood or synthetic material, ranging in length from about 40 to 60 inches (100 to 150
                    cm). The small end of the cue, with which the ball is struck, is fitted with a plastic, fibre, or
                    ivory reinforcement to which is cemented a leather cue tip. Chalk in small cubes is applied
                    uniformly to the cue tip permitting the players to strike the cue ball off centre on purpose in
                    order to impart a spinning motion, called “side” in Great Britain and “English” in the United
                    States. The billiard balls, formerly made of ivory or Belgian clay, are now usually plastic; they
                    each measure from about 21/4 to 23/8 inches (5.7 to 6 cm) in diameter, the larger balls being used
                    in carom billiards.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Different Kinds of Positions-</span>The secret to playing great pool
                    is pocketing balls. And the secret to pocketing balls is always getting closer to your next shot. We
                    do this by “playing position”. In this article I want to look at the types of position plays we can
                    make and the skills involved in making these plays. Understanding what skills you need to play great
                    position and then what skills you need to work on will help improve your position play, and your win
                    percentage. <br><br> The first kind of position that we can play is the simplest, stop ball
                    position. Here is a simple triangle of balls that we can take off by just using a stop shot.
                    <br><br> As you can see from this diagram, all we have to do to pocket these three balls is shoot
                    stop shots. The skill set required here is to be able to shoot stop shots at varying distances. A
                    great way to practice this is to just throw balls on the table and randomly shoot stop shots. You
                    aren’t trying to make the balls, just shoot stop shots at various distances. Not as easy as it
                    sounds. <br><br> The next type of position is similar to stop ball position, but requires
                    sophisticated cue ball manipulation. Punch forward an inch, draw back a diamond, hold the cue ball
                    inside a certain line, etc. There are many tricks to learn in how to control the distance and
                    direction the cue ball moves that you will learn from experience. Here is an old time exercise that
                    will help you learn the types of skills you need. <br><br> The object of this drill is to pocket all
                    the balls and keep the cue ball in the center of the circle. This will force you to manipulate the
                    cue ball small amounts and keep the correct lines on shots. You must stay in the circle and not bump
                    any balls when doing this drill. <br><br> The third type of position play is angles and speed
                    position. Here we want to make sure we get on the right side of the shot line so all we have to do
                    is pocket the object ball and roll the cue ball to our next position. The skill required here is
                    having the ability to roll the cue ball a desired distance. Here is this type of position play:
                    <br><br> Notice in this diagram that we are on the wrong side of the one ball!! To have a greater
                    margin of error we would rather be above the shot line here so that we can roll two rails and be
                    coming down the line of the shot, giving us a much greater margin of error for speed control.
                    <br><br> In this example, we need to be able to roll our cue ball to a much smaller target shown in
                    the circle. Understanding the difference between coming down the line, and how precise you have to
                    be, and coming across the line is a key concept in using angle and speed position. Try practicing
                    this shot as in the diagram to hone your ability to precisely control a rolling cue ball. It is
                    always better to be coming down the line, but it also nice to know that you have the skill set to
                    roll to a precise spot when you have to. <br><br> And the final type of position is execution
                    position. That is when you have to make a heroic shot to bail yourself out of a jam. A table length
                    draw with inside spin or something equally ridiculous. You would be better off playing safe when you
                    have to do too much with a shot. <br><br> Good luck understanding these types of position. Know what
                    you are weakest at and practice.</p>

                Regulation size billiard table?" Simply put, "Regulation" refers to the geometry of the play field,
                (cusion nose to cushion nose,) being exactly twice and long as it is wide. The length of a "Regulation
                Standard 8ft" table should be 88 inches long and 44 inches wide. A 9ft Regulation table play field
                measures 100 inches long and 50 inches wide. <br><br> Any size table can be considered as "Regulation"
                if the table is length and width ratio is consistant with these measurements. <br><br> The most common
                sized regulation tables are as follows: <br><br> Bar Size 7ft - (Playfield: 39" X 78") commonly called
                (Bar Size) as this is common to most coin-operated tables played in pubs and bars. <br><br>Standard 8ft
                - (Playfield: 44" X 88") This is the most common size sold in the USA for homes and private residences.
                <br><br> Tournament 9ft - (Playfield: 50" X 100") This is the full size the game of Billiards was
                invented on. It is still used in professional tournaments today.

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Billiards Rules-</span>Billiards (in this case referring to English
                Billiards) is a game that is popular not just in England but around the world thanks to its popularity
                during the time of the British Empire. Billiards is a cue sport that is played by two players and
                utilises one object ball (red) and two cue balls (yellow and white) <br> Each player uses a different
                color cue ball and attempts to score more points than their opponent and reach the previously agreed
                total required to win the match <br>There are many forms of Billiards around the world, but it is
                English Billiards that is one of the most common and most popular. Originating in England, it is an
                amalgamation of a number of different games, including the ‘winning and losing carambole game’. The game
                is played across the world, especially in Commonwealth countries but over the last 30-years it has seen
                its popularity decline as snooker (a more straightforward and TV friendly game) has rocketed in the
                numbers both playing and watching on TV</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Object of the Game-</span>The object of a game of Billiards is to score
                more points than your opponent, reaching the agreed amount that is needed to win the game. Like chess,
                it’s an immensely tactical game that requires players to think both attacking and defensively at the
                same time. Although not a physical game in any sense of the word, it is a game that requires a
                tremendous degree of mental dexterity and concentration.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Players & Equipment-</span>English Billiards can be played one-vs-one or
                two-vs-two with the singles version of the game being the most popular. The game is played on a table
                that has exactly the same dimensions (3569 mm x 1778 mm) as a snooker table, and in many places both
                games are played on the same table. Three balls must also be used, one red, one yellow and one white,
                and each must be 52.5mm in size. <br><br> Players have a cue each which can be made from wood or
                fibreglass and this is used for striking the balls. The last essential piece of equipment is chalk.
                During the game, each player will chalk the end of their cue to ensure there is good contact between the
                cue and the ball.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scoring-</span>In English Billiards, scoring is as follows:

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">A cannon:</span> This is where the cue ball is struck so that it
                    hits the red and other cue ball (in any order) on the same shot. This scores two points.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">A pot:</span>This is when the red ball is struck by the player's
                    cue ball so that the red ends up entering a pocket. This scores three points. If the player’s cue
                    ball strikes the other cue ball resulting it going down the pocket, then this scores two points.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">In-off:</span>This occurs when a player strikes their cue ball,
                    hitting another ball and then entering a pocket. This scores three points if the red was the first
                    ball hit and two points if it was the other player’s cue ball hit first.</li>
            </ul>
            Combinations of the above can be played in the same shot, with a maximum of ten points per shot possible.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Winning the Game-</span>English Billiards is won when one player (or
                team) reaches the agreed amount of points needed to win the game (often 300). Despite their being only
                three balls on the table at any one time, it is a very tactical game which requires a tremendous degree
                of savvy gameplay as well as skill to ensure that you keep ahead of your opponent. <br><br> As well as
                thinking in terms of attack and scoring points, it is essential for anyone who wants to win a game of
                billiards to think defensively at the same time and make things as difficult as they can for their
                opponent.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rules of Billiards-</span>
            <ul>
                <li>All games of Billiards shall be played with three balls, consisting of a red, yellow and white.</li>
                <li>Each of the two players has their own cue ball, one having the white ball, the other the yellow ball
                </li>
                <li>Both players must decide who is to break off first, and this is done by both players simultaneously
                    hitting their cue ball the length of the table, hitting the cushion and returning back towards them.
                    The player who gets their cue ball nearest to the baulk cushion at the end the shot was played gets
                    to choose who breaks</li>
                <li>The red is then placed on the Billiards sport and then the player going first places their cue ball
                    in the D and then plays the ball</li>
                <li>Players then take it in turn to attempt to score the most amount of points and eventually win the
                    game. Players can score in three ways:</li>
                <li>In-off: When your cue ball hits one of more balls and then goes down a pocket (2 / 3 points)</li>
                <li>Pot: This is when any ball other than your cue ball goes into a pocket (2 / 3 points).</li>
                <li>Cannon: This happens when the cue ball hits both other balls (2 points).</li>
                <li>Players remain on the table until they fail to make a scoring shot</li>
                <li>Following a foul, the opposing player has the option of having the balls all put on their spots or
                    leaving the table as it is</li>
                <li>The winner of the game is the first player to the points total that was declared the winning total
                    before the game</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TABLES, BALLS, EQUIPMENT-</span> All games described in these rules are
                designed for tables, balls and equipment meeting the standards prescribed in the BCA Equipment
                Specifications</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RACKING THE BALLS-</span>When racking the balls a triangle must be used,
                and the apex ball is to be spotted on the foot spot. All the balls must be lined up behind the apex ball
                and pressed together so that they all have contact with each other</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">STRIKING CUE BALL-</span>Legal shots require that the cue ball be struck
                only with the cue tip. Failure to meet this requirement is a foul.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> CALLING SHOTS-</span>For games of call-shot a player may shoot any ball
                he chooses, but before he shoots, must designate the called ball and called pocket. He need not indicate
                any detail such as kisses, caroms, combinations, or cushions (all of which are legal). “Any additionally
                pocketed ball(s) on a legal stroke is counted in the shooter’s favor.”</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">FAILURE TO POCKET A BALL-</span>If a player fails to pocket a ball on a
                legal shot, then the player’s inning is over, and it is the opponent’s turn at the table</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAG FOR BREAK-</span>The following procedure is used for the lag for the
                opening break. Each player should use balls of equal size and weight (preferably cue balls but, when not
                available, non-striped object balls). With the balls in hand behind the head string, one player to the
                left and one to the right of the head spot, the balls are shot simultaneously to the foot cushion and
                back to the head end of the table. The player whose ball is the closest to the innermost edge of the
                head cushion wins the lag. The lagged ball must contact the foot cushion at least once. Other cushion
                contacts are immaterial, except as prohibited below. It is an automatic loss of the lag if:
            <ul>
                <li>The ball crosses into the opponent’s half of the table;</li>
                <li>The ball fails to contact the foot cushion;</li>
                <li>The ball drops into a pocket</li>
                <li>The ball jumps off the table;</li>
                <li>The ball touches the long cushion;</li>
                <li>The ball rests within the corner pocket and past the nose of the head cushion, or;</li>
                <li>The ball contacts the foot rail more than once. If both players violate automatic-loss lag rules, or
                    if the referee is unable to determine which ball is closer, the lag is a tie and is replayed.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OPENING BREAK SHOT-</span>The opening break shot is determined by either
                lag or lot. (The lag for break procedure is required for formal competition.) The player winning the lag
                or lot has the choice of performing the opening break shot or assigning it to the opponent.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CUE BALL ON OPENING BREAK-</span>The opening break shot is taken with
                cue ball in hand behind the head string. The object balls are positioned according to specific game
                rules. On the opening break, the game is considered to have commenced once the cue ball has been struck
                by the cue tip</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">DEFLECTING THE CUE BALL ON THE GAME’S OPENING BREAK-</span>On the break
                shot, stopping or deflecting the cue ball after it has crossed the head string and prior to hitting the
                racked balls is considered a foul and loss of turn. The opponent has the option of receiving cue ball in
                hand behind the head string or passing the cue ball in hand behind the head string back to the offending
                player. (Exception: 9-Ball, see rule 5.3: “cue ball in hand anywhere on the table”). A warning must be
                given that a second violation during the match will result in the loss of the match by forfeiture. (See
                Rule 3.28.)</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CUE BALL IN HAND BEHIND THE HEAD STRING-</span>This situation applies in
                specific games whereby the opening break is administered or a player’s scratching is penalized by the
                incoming player having cue ball in hand behind the head string. The incoming player may place the cue
                ball anywhere behind the head string. The shooting player may shoot at any object ball as long as the
                base of the object ball is on or below the head string. He may not shoot at any ball, the base of which
                is above the head string, unless he first shoots the cue ball below the head string and then by hitting
                a rail causes the cue ball to come back above the head string and hit the object ball. The base of the
                ball (the point of the ball touching the table) determines whether it is above or below the head string.
                If the incoming player inadvertently places the cue ball on or below the head string, the referee or the
                op-posing player must inform the shooting player of improper positioning of the cue ball before the shot
                is made. If the opposing player does not so inform the shooting player before the shot is made, the shot
                is considered legal. If the shooting player is informed of improper positioning, he must then reposition
                the cue ball. If a player positions the cue ball completely and obviously outside the kitchen and shoots
                the cue ball, it is a foul. When the cue ball is in hand behind the head string, it remains in hand (not
                in play) until the player strikes the cue ball with his cue tip. The cue ball may be adjusted by the
                player’s hand, cue, etc., so long as it remains in hand. Once the cue ball is in play per the above, it
                may not be impeded in any way by the player; to do so is to commit a foul. Additionally, if the shot
                fails to contact a legal object ball or fails to drive the cue ball over the head string, the shot is a
                foul and the opposing player has ball in hand according to the specific game rules.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">POCKETED BALLS-</span>A ball is considered pocketed if as a result of an
                otherwise legal shot, it drops off the bed of the table into the pocket and remains there. (A ball that
                drops out of a ball return system onto the floor is not to be construed as a ball that has not remained
                pocketed.) A ball that rebounds from a pocket back onto the table bed is not a pocketed ball</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">POSITION OF BALLS-</span>The position of a ball is judged by where its
                base (or center) rests.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">FOOT ON FLOOR-</span>Player must have at least one foot in contact with
                the floor at the moment the cue tip contacts the cue ball, or the shot is a foul. Foot attire must be
                normal in regard to size, shape and manner in which it is worn.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SHOOTING WITH BALLS IN MOTION-</span>It is a foul if a player shoots
                while the cue ball or any object ball is in motion (a spinning ball is in motion).</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMPLETION OF STROKE-</span>A stroke is not complete (and therefore is
                not counted) until all balls on the table have become motionless after the stroke (a spinning ball is in
                motion).</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> HEAD STRING DEFINED-</span>The area behind the head string does not
                include the head string. Thus, an object ball that is dead center on the head string is playable when
                specific game rules require that a player must shoot at a ball past the head string. Likewise, the cue
                ball when being put in play behind the head string (cue ball in hand behind the head string), may not be
                placed directly on the head string; it must be behind it.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GENERAL RULE, ALL FOULS-</span> <br> Though the penalties for fouls
                differ from game to game, the following apply to all fouls:
            <ul>
                <li>Player’s inning ends;</li>
                <li>If on a stroke, the stroke is invalid and any pocketed balls are not counted to the shooter’s
                    credit, and;</li>
                <li> Any ball(s) is re-spotted only if the rules of the specific game require it.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> FAILURE TO CONTACT OBJECT BALL-</span>It is a foul if on a stroke the
                cue ball fails to make contact with any legal object ball first. Playing away from a touching ball does
                not constitute having hit that ball.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LEGAL SHOT-</span>Unless otherwise stated in a specific game rule, a
                player must cause the cue ball to contact a legal object ball and then:
            <ul>
                <li>Pocket a numbered ball, or;</li>
                <li>Cause the cue ball or any numbered ball to contact a cushion or any part of the rail. Failure to
                    meet these requirements is a foul.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CUE BALL SCRATCH-</span>It is a foul (scratch) if on a stroke, the cue
                ball is pocketed. If the cue ball touches an object ball that was already pocketed (for example, in a
                pocket full of object balls), the shot is a foul.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">FOULS BY TOUCHING BALLS-</span>It is a foul to strike, touch or in any
                way make contact with the cue ball in play or any object balls in play with anything (the body,
                clothing, chalk, me- mechanical bridge, cue shaft, etc.) except the cue tip (while attached to the cue
                shaft), which may contact the cue ball in the execution of a legal shot. Whenever a referee is presiding
                over a match, any object ball moved during a standard foul must be returned as closely as possible to
                its original position as judged by the referee, and the incoming player does not have the option of
                restoration.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">FOUL BY PLACEMENT-</span>Touching any object ball with the cue ball
                while it is in hand is a foul.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">FOULS BY DOUBLE HITS-</span>If the cue ball is touching the required
                object ball prior to the shot, the player may shoot toward it, providing that any normal stroke is
                employed. If the cue stick strikes the cue ball more than once on a shot, or if the cue stick is in
                contact with the cue ball when or after the cue ball contacts an object ball, the shot is a foul. ( for
                judging this kind of shot.) If a third ball is close by, care should be taken not to foul that ball
                under the first part of this rule.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PUSH SHOT FOULS-</span>It is a foul if the cue ball is pushed by the cue
                tip, with contact being maintained for more than the momentary time commensurate with a stroked shot.
                (Such shots are usually referred to as push shots.)</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PLAYER RESPONSIBILITY FOULS-</span>The player is responsible for chalk,
                bridges, files and any other items or equipment he brings to, uses at, or causes to approximate the
                table. If he drops a piece of chalk, or knocks off a mechanical bridge head, as examples, he is guilty
                of a foul should such an object make contact with any ball in play (or the cue ball only if no referee
                is presiding over the match).</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ILLEGAL JUMPING OF BALL-</span>It is a foul if a player strikes the cue
                ball below center (“digs under” or “lofts” the cue ball) and intentionally causes it to rise off the bed
                of the table in an effort to clear an obstructing ball. Such jumping action may occasionally occur
                accidentally, and such “jumps” are not to be considered fouls on their face; they may still be ruled
                foul strokes, if for example, the ferrule or cue shaft makes contact with the cue ball in the course of
                the shot.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">JUMP SHOTS-</span>Unless otherwise stated in rules for a specific game
                it is legal to cause the cue ball to rise off the bed of the table by elevating the cue stick on the
                shot, and forcing the cue ball to rebound from the bed of the table. Any miscue when executing a jump
                shot is a foul.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BALLS JUMPED OFF TABLE-</span>Balls coming to rest other than on the bed
                of the table after a stroke (on the cushion top, rail surface, floor, etc.) are considered jumped balls.
                Balls may bounce on the cushion tops and rails of the table in play without being jumped balls if they
                return to the bed of the table under their own power and without touching anything not a part of the
                table. The table shall consist of the permanent part of the table proper. (Balls that strike or touch
                anything not a part of the table, such as the light fixture, chalk on the rails and cushion tops, etc.,
                shall be considered jumped balls even though they might return to the bed of the table after contacting
                items which are not parts of the table proper). In all pocket billiard games, when a stroke results in
                the cue ball or any object ball being a jumped ball off the table, the stroke is a foul. All jumped
                object balls are spotted (except in 8 and 9-Ball) when all balls have stopped moving. See specific game
                rules for putting the cue ball in play after a jumped cue ball foul.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPECIAL INTENTIONAL FOUL PENALTY-</span>The cue ball in play shall not
                be intentionally struck with anything other than a cue’s attached tip (such as the ferrule, shaft,
                etc.). While such contact is automatically a foul under the provisions of Rule 3.19, if the referee
                deems the contact to be intentional, he shall warn the player once during a match that a second
                violation during that match will result in the loss of the match by forfeiture. If a second violation
                does occur, the match must be forfeited</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ONE FOUL LIMIT-</span>Unless specific game rules dictate otherwise, only
                one foul is assessed on a player in each inning; if different penalties can apply, the most severe
                penalty is the factor determining which foul is assessed</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BALLS MOVING SPONTANEOUSLY-</span>If a ball shifts, settles, turns or
                otherwise moves “by itself,” the ball shall remain in the position it assumed and play continues. A
                hanging ball that falls into a pocket “by itself” after being motionless for 5 seconds or longer shall
                be replaced as closely as possible to its position prior to falling, and play shall continue. If an
                object ball drops into a pocket “by itself” as a player shoots at it, so that the cue ball passes over
                the spot the ball had been on, unable to hit it, the cue ball and object ball are to be replaced to
                their positions prior to the stroke, and the player may shoot again. Any other object balls disturbed on
                the stroke are also to be replaced to their original positions before the shooter replays.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPOTTING BALLS-</span>When specific game rules call for spotting balls,
                they shall be replaced on the table on the long string after the stroke is complete. A single ball is
                placed on the foot spot; if more than one ball is to be spotted, they are placed on the long string in
                ascending numerical order, beginning on the foot spot and advancing toward the foot rail. When balls on
                or near the foot spot or long string interfere with the spotting of balls, the balls to be spotted are
                placed on the extension of the long string “in front” of the foot spot (between the foot spot and the
                center spot), as near as possible to the foot spot and in the same numerical order as if they were
                spotted “behind” the foot spot (lowest numbered ball closest to the foot spot).</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">JAWED BALLS-</span>If two or more balls are locked between the jaws or
                sides of the pocket, with one or more suspended in air, the referee shall inspect the balls in position
                and follow this procedure: he shall visually (or physically if he desires) project each ball directly
                downward from its locked position; any ball that in his judgement would fall in the pocket if so moved
                directly downward is a pocketed ball, while any ball that would come to rest on the bed of the table is
                not pocketed. The balls are then placed according to the referee’s assessment, and play continues
                according to specific game rules as if no locking or jawing of balls had occurred.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ADDITIONAL POCKETED BALLS-</span>If extra balls are pocketed on a legal
                scoring stroke, they are counted in accord with the scoring rules for the particular game.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NON-PLAYER INTERFERENCE-</span>If the balls are moved (or a player
                bumped such that play is directly affected) by a non-player during the match, the balls shall be
                replaced as near as possible to their original positions immediately prior to the incident, and play
                shall resume with no penalty on the player affected. If the match is officiated, the referee shall
                replace the balls. This rule also applies to “act of God” interferences, such as earthquakes,
                hurricanes, light fixture falling, power failures, etc. If the balls cannot be restored to their
                original positions, replay the game with the original player breaking. This rule is not applicable to
                14.1 Continuous where the game consists of successive racks: the rack in progress will be discontinued
                and a completely new rack will be started with the requirements of the normal opening break (players lag
                for break). Scoring of points is to be resumed at the score as it stood at the moment of game
                disruption.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BREAKING SUBSEQUENT RACKS-</span>In a match that consists of short rack
                games, the winner of each game breaks in the next. The following are common options that may be
                designated by tournament officials in advance:
            <ul>
                <li>Players alternate break.</li>
                <li>Loser breaks</li>
                <li>Player trailing in game count breaks the next game.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PLAY BY INNINGS-</span>During the course of play, players alternate
                turns (innings) at the table, with a player’s inning ending when he either fails to legally pocket a
                ball, or fouls. When an inning ends free of a foul, the incoming player accepts the table in position.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECT BALL FROZEN TO CUSHION OR CUE BALL-</span>This rule applies to
                any shot where the cue ball’s first contact with a ball is with one that is frozen to a cushion or to
                the cue ball itself. After the cue ball makes contact with the frozen object ball, the shot must result
                in either:
            <ul>
                <li>A ball being pocketed, or;</li>
                <li>The cue ball contacting a cushion, or;</li>
                <li>The frozen ball being caused to contact a cushion attached to a separate rail, or;</li>
                <li>Another object ball being caused to contact a cushion with which it was not already in contact.
                    Failure to satisfy one of those four requirements is a foul. (Note: 14.1 and other games specify
                    additional requirements and applications of this rule; see specific game rules.) A ball which is
                    touching a cushion at the start of a shot and then is forced into a cushion attached to the same
                    rail is not considered to have been driven to that cushion unless it leaves the cushion, contacts
                    another ball, and then contacts the cushion again. An object ball is not considered frozen to a
                    cushion unless it is examined and announced as such by either the referee or one of the players
                    prior to that object ball being involved in a shot</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PLAYING FROM BEHIND THE STRING-</span>When a player has the cue ball in
                hand behind the head string (in the kitchen), he must drive the cue ball to a point across the head
                string before it contacts either a cushion, an object ball, or returns to the kitchen. Failure to do so
                is a foul if a referee is presiding over a match. If no referee, the opponent has the option to call it
                either a foul or to require the offending player to replay the shot again with the balls restored to
                their positions prior to the shot (and with no foul penalty imposed). Exception: if an object ball lies
                on or outside the head string (and is thus playable) but so close that the cue ball contacts it before
                the cue ball is out of the kitchen, the ball can be legally played, and will be considered to have
                crossed the head string. If, with cue ball in hand behind the headstring and while the shooter is
                attempting a legitimate shot, the cue ball accidentally hits a ball behind the head string, and the cue
                ball crosses the line, it is a foul. If with cue ball in hand behind the head string, the shooter causes
                the cue ball to hit an object ball accidentally, and the cue ball does not cross the headstring, the
                following applies: the incoming player has the option of calling a foul and having cue ball in hand, or
                having the balls returned to their original position, and having the offending player replay the shot.
                If a player under the same conditions intentionally causes the cue ball to contact an object ball behind
                the headstring, it is unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CUE BALL IN HAND FOUL-</span>During cue ball in hand placement, the
                player may use his hand or any part of his cue (including the tip) to position the cue ball. When
                placing the cue ball in position, any forward stroke motion of the cue stick contacting the cue ball
                will be considered a foul if not a legal shot.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">INTERFERENCE-</span>If the non-shooting player distracts his opponent or
                interferes with his play, he has fouled. If a player shoots out of turn, or moves any ball except during
                his inning, it is considered to be interference.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> DEVICES-</span>Players are not allowed to use a ball, the triangle or
                any other width-measuring device to see if the cue ball or an object ball would travel through a gap,
                etc. Only the cue stick may be used as an aid to judge gaps or as an aid to aligning a shot., so long as
                the cue is held by the hand. To do so otherwise is a foul and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ILLEGAL MARKING-</span>If a player intentionally marks the table in any
                way (including the placement of chalk) to assist in executing the shot, it is a foul.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">USE OF EQUIPMENT-</span>Players may not use equipment or accessory items
                for purposes or in a manner other than those for which the items were intended (refer to rules 3.42 and
                3.43). For example, powder containers, chalk cubes, etc., may not be used to prop up a mechanical bridge
                (or natural hand bridge); no more than two mechanical bridges may be used at one time, nor may they be
                used to support anything other than the cue shaft. Extra or out-of-play balls may not be used by players
                to check clearance or for any other reason (except to lag for break); the triangle may be employed to
                ascertain whether a ball is in the rack when a match is unofficiated and the table has not been pencil
                marked around the triangle area</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">EQUIPMENT RESTRICTIONS-</span> <br> The following is a list of
                acceptable equipment items a player may bring to the table to use in a World Pool-Billiard Association
                sanctioned event:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cue Stick -</span>Each player is permitted to use one or more cue
                    sticks that meet the specifications listed in the equipment specifications section. He may use
                    either a built-in extender or an add-on extender to increase the length of the stick.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Chalk -</span>The player may apply chalk to his tip to prevent
                    miscues, and may use his own chalk, provided its color is compatible with the cloth.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mechanical Bridges -</span>Mechanical Bridges - The player may use
                    up to two mechanical bridges to support the cue stick during the shot. He may use his own bridge if
                    it is similar to standard commercial bridges.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gloves -</span>The player may use gloves to improve the grip and/or
                    bridge hand function.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> CUE BALL FOULS ONLY-</span>When a referee is presiding over a match, it
                is a foul for a player to touch any ball (cue ball or object ball) with the cue, clothing, body,
                mechanical bridge or chalk, before, during or after a shot. However, when a referee is not presiding
                over a game, it is not a foul to accidentally touch stationary balls located between the cue ball and
                the shooter while in the act of shooting. If such an accident occurs, the player should allow the
                Tournament Director to restore the object balls to their correct positions. If the player does not allow
                such a restoration, and a ball set in motion as a normal part of the shot touches such an unrestored
                ball, or passes partly into a region originally occupied by a disturbed ball, the shot is a foul. In
                short, if the accident has any effect on the outcome of the shot, it is a foul. In any case, the
                Tournament Director must be called upon to restore the positions of the disturbed balls as soon as
                possible, but not during the shot. It is a foul to play another shot before the Tournament Director has
                restored any accidentally moved balls. At the non-shooting player’s option, the disturbed balls will be
                left in their new positions. In this case, the balls are considered restored, and subsequent contact on
                them is not a foul. It is still a foul to make any contact with the cue ball whatsoever while it is in
                play, except for the normal tip-to-ball contact during a shot.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">REFEREE’S RESPONSIVENESS-</span>The referee shall be totally responsive
                to players’ inquiries regarding objective data, such as whether a ball will be in the rack, if a ball is
                in the kitchen, what the count is, how many points are needed for a victory, if a player or his opponent
                is on a foul, what rule would apply if a certain shot is made, etc. When asked for a clarification of a
                rule, the referee will explain the applicable rule to the best of his ability, but any misstatement by
                the referee will not protect a player from enforcement of the actual rules. The referee must not offer
                or provide any subjective opinion that would affect play, such as whether a good hit can be made on a
                prospective shot, whether a combination can be made, or how the table seems to be playing, etc.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">INAPPROPRIATE USE OF EQUIPMENT-</span>The referee should be alert for a
                player using equipment or accessory items for purposes or in a manner other than those for which they
                were intended, or for the use of illegal equipment, as defined under “equipment specification”.
                Generally no penalty is applied. However, should a player persist in such activity or use of such
                equipment, after having been advised that such activity or use is not permissible, the referee or other
                tournament official may take action as appropriate under the provisions of “Unsportsmanlike Conduct”</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">JUDGING DOUBLE HITS-</span>When the distance between the cue ball and
                the object ball is less than the width of a chalk cube, (See Diagram 18) special attention from the
                referee is required. In such a situation, unless the referee can positively determine a legal shot has
                been performed, the following guidance may apply: if the cue ball follows through the object ball more
                than 1/2 ball, it is a foul.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OUT OF HEAD STRING WARNING-</span>When a player has the cue ball in hand
                behind the head string, the referee shall warn him before he shoots if he has placed the cue ball on or
                within 1/2 ball width outside of the head string. If the player then shoots from on or within the
                specified distance outside the head string, the stroke is a foul. If the shooter places the cue ball
                outside of the head string beyond the specified limit, no warning is required and the stroke is a foul
                (See specific game rule for penalty.</p>

                    because they were all nuts for pool! <br><br> Another interesting player to consider as the best
                    ever is Albert M. Frey, who was winning nearly every match almost as soon as the first native
                    American pool games had been invented. According to Michael Phelan, the father of American pool, the
                    first national pool championship took place in 1878. Albert Frey the "blonde boy" wonder and darling
                    of the crowds, made his public debut on December 30, 1880. He won the first professional eight-ball
                    tournament at Republican Hall, NYC, in May 1882. He became the world champion of another new game,
                    fifteen-ball or 61-pool, also in 1882. By 1884, Frey was "almost invariably winning" according to
                    Phelan, while competing against stars like George F. Sutton, James L. Malone, Cyrille "The Bismarck
                    of Billiards" Dion, Alfredo de Oro and Jake "The Wizard" Schaefer. From 1881-1887, Frey won every
                    fifteen-ball championship match or finished second. In 1888, Frey won the first continuous pool
                    (straight pool) tournament, beating Malone in a playoff. In 1889, Frey was tied for first place in
                    the national championship tournament, when he died suddenly of pneumonia. At the time of his death,
                    he had been dominating the American pool scene, whether the game was fifteen-ball, eight-ball or
                    continuous pool. Frey was "widely known as the champion pool player of America," according to his
                    obit in The New York Times. Malone had a crown delivered to the funeral, a touching tribute since he
                    had been Frey's greatest and most determined obstacle to the crown. <br><br>If we can look
                    northward, another fascinating player is Cyrille Dion, a French-Canadian born in Montreal in 1843.
                    Dion was the billiards champion of Canada in 1865, at age 22, with a high run of 138 and a grand
                    average of 12.76. He won the 1866 Tournament of State and Provincial Champions, again going
                    undefeated with a high run of 127 and a grand average of 11.28. In 1870-1871 he won a series of
                    four-ball championship matches against stars who included the French champion A. P. Rudolphe and
                    Americans Frank Parker and Melvin Foster. Dion won the American four-ball championship in 1873, with
                    a high run of 127 and a grand average of 11.28. He won the straight rail championship in 1875. In
                    1876 Dion won the four-ball championship by such a wide margin, 1500-392, that The New York Times
                    predicted there would never be another four-ball championship match. In 1878, Dion won the first
                    American National Championship pool tournament. He died just six months later, at age 35, from
                    severe lung congestion that had plagued him for years. He was the undefeated champion of the first
                    major Canadian billiards tournament, the undefeated champion of the last American four-ball
                    billiards tournament, and the undefeated champion of the first major American pool tournament. He
                    had nerves of steel and was ready, willing and able to play anyone, as reported by the Fort Wayne
                    Daily Gazette on July 18, 1871: "Cyrille Dion has issued a notice in which he challenges anyone in
                    the world to play him a game of three-ball or French carom billiards, the amount of stakes to be not
                    less than five hundred dollar a side. It is thought in billiard circles that an International
                    contest will be the result of this challenge." <br><br>

                    In the modern era, Efren "The Magician" Reyes may well be the best all-around player. Reyes is a
                    master of eight-ball, nine-ball, ten-ball, rotation, one-pocket, straight pool, snooker, 18.1
                    balkline and three-cushion billiards. And he claimed the richest purse in pool history, $163,172 in
                    the 2001 Tokyo Nine-Ball Championship. But whether he's better than Worst is a matter of
                    speculation, if you'll pardon the pun.</p>

                    The World Billiards Championship is an international cue sports tournament in the discipline of
                    English billiards, organised by World Billiards, a subsidiary of the World Professional Billiards
                    and Snooker Association (WPBSA). In its various forms, and usually as a single competition, the
                    title is one of the oldest sporting world championships, having been contested (though irregularly)
                    since 1870. <br><br>

                    From 2012 to 2014 there were separate timed and points divisions, with the tournament held in
                    association with the International Billiards and Snooker Federation. In those years, there was no
                    separate IBSF World Billiards Championship. <br><br>

                    The rules adopted by the Billiards Association in 1899 are essentially the rules still used today.
                    The tournament has been played on a regular annual schedule since 1980, when it became administered
                    by the WPBSA. The event was known as the World Professional Billiards Championship until 2010, and
                    has had other names in the past, e.g. Billiards Championship of the World. In addition, the World
                    Ladies Billiards Championship has been played since 1931 (with interruptions) and organized by World
                    Ladies Billiards and Snooker since 1998. <br><br> In the early 19th century, there was no recognised
                    governing body or formal championship for English billiards. Jack Carr and Edwin Kentfield were
                    prominent players when Carr challenged Kentfield to a championship game in 1825. Carr died on the
                    eve of the match, and Kentfield hence assumed the title. He would remain unchallenged for 24 years.
                    <br>

                    John Roberts Sr., who had spent years touring and establishing his reputation as a billiards player,
                    challenged Kentfield. There was much controversy over the table and the pockets to be used, and
                    Kentfield declined to play, so Roberts styled himself as champion, a title he held unchallenged
                    until 1870, when he lost to William Cook. <br>

                    Cook beat Roberts's son John Roberts Jr. in a match in 1869, and challenged Roberts Sr. for the
                    title. As this was the first actual match for the World Championship, the players themselves drew up
                    a special set of rules for the game. Roberts managed to have the pocket width reduced to 3 inches
                    (from the original inches), and the "D" and spots were adjusted so that Cook's spot stroke strength,
                    derived from his proficiency at consecutively potting the red ball from its spot, was weakened. Cook
                    was nonetheless considered the favourite, and the 20-year-old had greatly improved since his win
                    over Roberts Jr. the previous year. At 1:38 a.m. on the morning of 12 February 1870, Cook defeated
                    Roberts to win the title, and won a newly created trophy, £100, and a Maltese cross. The match at
                    St. James's Hall in London was attended by Edward VII, the Prince of Wales. This match ended the
                    dominance of Roberts Sr., as a wave of new players took over the game. <br>

                    The February 1870 match initiated the World Championship, and led to many challenges for the title.
                    Roberts Jr. and Cook were the dominant players of the era. There were occasional uncontested
                    matches. The rule said that a player had to accept a challenge within two months of it being issued;
                    if the challenge were ignored, the challenger became World Champion. <br>

                    There was still the issue of the rules, however. Many players preferred the "spot-barred" style with
                    limitations on the number of consecutive pots of the red that were allowed, but some preferred the
                    "all-in" rules that did not include this restriction. Repeated potting of the red was a great
                    strength for William Peall in particular. <br>

                    There were three all-in competitions held separately from the title held by Roberts, for which he
                    was never challenged. Billy Mitchell and Peall excelled in the late 1880s.</p>

            <p class="py-3">The most pool balls potted into the middle pocket over an obstacle in one minute is 75, and
                was achieved by Florian Kohler (France) in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on 16 December 2018. <br><br>Florian
                beat his own record by 5 balls. <br><br>Florian "Venom" Kohler (born July 10, 1988) is a pool trick shot
                player, particularly known for his massé shots. <br><br>Growing up in eastern France, Kohler did not
                start playing pool until the age of 18, when he received a 6-foot pool table as a birthday gift from his
                parents.[1] Kohler started watching exhibition videos online and trying to imitate shots in them.[2] His
                influences include Mike Massey and Semih Sayginer.

                He began experimenting with his own versions of trick shots, and eventually developed many new concepts,
                such as ball jumping, massé-ing with multiple cues simultaneously, executing jump and massé shots on
                moving balls, and executing very high jumps. He has set a record for highest jump shot on a moving ball,
                at 34 inches (86 centimeters). <br><br>

                Kohler assisted in the development of the Mezz massé cue, which is specially designed to execute trick
                shots. <br><br>

                APA announced they would be sponsoring Florian Kholer and he would be an official spokesperson for APA
                on April 28, 2014 at their Annual League Operator Convention in Las Vegas. <br><br>

                In mid 2019 he and his wife became league operators for the APA Las Vegas Division.

                Kohler currently has 6 Guinness world records:
            <ul>
                <li>playing with the longest usable pool cue (17 ft 7.4 in)</li>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> About The Game</span> Badminton is a racket sport played by either
                    two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite
                    halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by striking a
                    shuttlecock with their racket so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of
                    the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be
                    struck once by each side before it passes over the net.</p>
                <p>The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it
                    to fly differently from the balls used in most racket sports; in particular, the feathers create
                    much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have
                    a much higher top speed, when compared to other racket sports. As the shuttlecock flight is
                    stubbornly affected by wind, competitive badminton is always played indoors. Badminton is also
                    played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.

                    Since 1992, badminton has been an Olympic sport with five events: men's and women's singles, men's
                    and women's doubles, and mixed doubles, in which each pair is a man and a woman. At high levels of
                    play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength,
                    speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the
                    development of sophisticated racket movements.

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">STRATEGY</h3>
                <p>
                    To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These
                    range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a
                    smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a net shot can force the
                    opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the net shot is tight and
                    tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent
                    smash much harder to return.

                    Deception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical
                    and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an
                    opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, they may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to
                    change their body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> SINGLES</span>
                    <br>Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the
                    opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the
                    corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with
                    drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the
                    smasher has no partner to follow up their effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed
                    return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a
                    player's energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to
                    create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.

                    In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low
                    serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.

                    At high levels of play, singles demand extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient
                    positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">DOUBLES</span><br> Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the
                    attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an
                    ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court, and their partner in the
                    midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rear court attacker plays a drop
                    shot, their partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit
                    downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift
                    or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear
                    midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players
                    generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and
                    clashes.

                    At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves
                    have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in
                    an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent
                    the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.

                    At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles are the most aggressive
                    form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges.
                    Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MIXED DOUBLES</span> <br> In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try
                    to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is
                    because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can, therefore, produce smashes
                    that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler
                    positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman
                    towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed
                    players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.

                    At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are
                    capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the
                    opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position,
                    with the woman in front and men in the back.</p>

                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Court-</span><br> The court is rectangular and divided into halves
                    by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules
                    permit a court to be marked for singles only.[13] The doubles court is wider than the singles court,
                    but both are of the same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is
                    that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.

                    The full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 feet), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18
                    metres (17.0 feet). The full length of the court is 13.4 metres (44 feet). The service courts are
                    marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of
                    1.98 metres (6 feet 6 inches) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles,
                    the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 metres (2 feet 6 inches) from
                    the back boundary.

                    The net is 1.55 metres (5 feet 1 inch) high at the edges and 1.524 metres (5.00 feet) high in the
                    centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

                    The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton.
                    Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high
                    serve.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Serving</span><br>
                    When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents'
                    court or it will count as a fault. The server and receiver must remain within their service courts,
                    without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players
                    may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.

                    At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service courts . The
                    server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar
                    to tennis, except that in a badminton serve the whole shuttle must be below 1.15 metres from the
                    surface of the court at the instant of being hit by the server's racket, the shuttlecock is not
                    allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts, unlike tennis.

                    When the serving side loses a rally, the server immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this
                    differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is
                    known as a "second serve").

                    In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in their
                    left service court when their score is odd.

                    In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes
                    service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the
                    rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player
                    in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at
                    the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A
                    consequence of this system is that each time a side regains the service, the server will be the
                    player who did not serve last time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scoring</span><br> Each game is played to 21 points, with players
                    scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served[13] (this differs from
                    the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15
                    points). A match is the best of three games.

                    If the score ties at 20–20, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as
                    24–22), except when there is a tie at 29–29, in which the game goes to a golden point of 30. Whoever
                    scores this point wins the game.

                    At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is
                    pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to
                    serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy first, and their opponents
                    making the leftover the remaining choice.

                    In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a
                    player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any
                    doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives.
                    The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they
                    change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11
                    points.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lets</span><br>
                    If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur
                    because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court (having been hit
                    there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail
                    which can be classed as a let.
                    <br>
                    If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the
                    receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been ready.

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY OF BADMINTON</h3>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Early Years-</span>Games employing shuttlecocks have been played
                    for centuries across Eurasia,[a] but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century
                    among the expatriate officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and
                    shuttlecock. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".)[4] Its exact origin remains obscure.
                    The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire,[5] but why or when
                    remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet
                    entitled Badminton Battledore – A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived.[6] An 1863
                    article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with
                    sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground"
                </p>
                <p>The game originally developed in India among the British expatriates,[8] where it was very popular by
                    the 1870s.[6] Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock,
                    was being played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s[9] and was at first played interchangeably with
                    badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

                    Early on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of Poona, where it was
                    particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873. By 1875, officers
                    returning home had started a badminton club in Folkestone. Initially, the sport was played with
                    sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four
                    competitors worked the best. The shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and, in outdoor play,
                    sometimes weighted with lead. Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred
                    that it should reach the ground</p>
                <div class="badminton-history">


                    <p>The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath Badminton
                        Club drew up revised regulations. In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules. The
                        Badminton Association of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the
                        sport at a house called "Dunbar" in Portsmouth on 13 September. The BAE started the first
                        badminton competition, the All England Open Badminton Championships for gentlemen's doubles,
                        ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899. Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an
                        England–Ireland championship match appeared in 1904.
                        <br>
                        England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand
                        were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in 1934, now known as the
                        Badminton World Federation. India joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs
                        international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men's badminton has
                        traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant
                        in international competition. China, Denmark, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, South Korea, Taiwan
                        (playing as 'Chinese Taipei') and Japan are the nations which have consistently produced
                        world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and
                        women's competition recently.

                        The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the United States.

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">COMPETIIONS</h3>
                <P>The BWF organizes several international competitions, including the Thomas Cup, the premier men's
                    international team event first held in 1948–1949, and the Uber Cup, the women's equivalent first
                    held in 1956–1957. The competitions now take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams
                    compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The
                    final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004. It was further
                    increased to 16 teams in 2012.[22]</P>
                <p>
                    The Sudirman Cup, a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989.
                    Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament,
                    a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles
                    and singles, and mixed doubles). Like association football (soccer), it features a promotion and
                    relegation system at every level. However, the system was last used in 2009 and teams competing will
                    now be grouped by world rankings.[23]
                    <br>
                </p>
                Badminton was a demonstration event at the 1972 and 1988 Summer Olympics. It became an official Summer
                Olympic sport at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport's
                most coveted prizes for individual players.
                <br>
                In the BWF World Championships, first held in 1977, currently only the highest-ranked 64 players in the
                world, and a maximum of four from each country can participate in any category. In both the Olympic and
                BWF World competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some
                controversy because they sometimes result in excluding elite world level players from the strongest
                badminton nations. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and World
                Junior Championships), are all categorized as level one tournaments.
                <br>
                <p>
                    At the start of 2007, the BWF introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level
                    tournaments aside from those in level one: the BWF Super Series. This level two tournament series, a
                    tour for the world's elite players, stage twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players
                    (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super
                    Series Finals held at the year-end. Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable
                    All-England Championships, first held in 1900, which was once considered the unofficial world
                    championships of the sport.[24]
                    <br>
                    Level three tournaments consist of Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event. Top players can collect the
                    world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include
                    the regional competitions in Asia (Badminton Asia Championships) and Europe (European Badminton
                    Championships), which produce the world's best players as well as the Pan America Badminton
                    Championships.
                    <br>
                    The level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series, and Future
                    Series, encourage participation by junior players.

                <p>The BWF World Championships, formerly known as IBF World Championships, and also known as the World
                    Badminton Championships, is a badminton tournament sanctioned by Badminton World Federation (BWF).
                    The tournament is one of the most prestigious in badminton, offering the most ranking points,
                    together with the Summer Olympics badminton tournaments which was first introduced in 1992. The
                    winners of this tournament are also crowned as "World Champions" of the sport, and are awarded a
                    gold medal.

                    The tournament started in 1977 and was held once every three years until 1983. However, the IBF
                    (International Badminton Federation) faced difficulty in hosting the first two events as the World
                    Badminton Federation (which later merged with the IBF to form one badminton federation) hosted the
                    same tournament a year after the IBF World Championships with the same goals.

                    Since 1985, the tournament became biennial and played once every two years until 2005. Starting
                    2006, the tournament was changed to an annual event on the BWF calendar. The tournament is not held
                    during the Summer Olympics years to avoid schedule conflicts.</p>

                <p>Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move
                    through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive
                    swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in butterfly,
                    backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events,
                    four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four
                    swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and
                    freestyle.</p>
                <p>Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct
                    regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke. There are also regulations on
                    what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions. Although it
                    is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in
                    the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.</p>

                        least 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) wide. They will be equipped with starting blocks at both ends of the
                        pool and most will have Automatic Officiating Equipment, including touch pads to record times
                        and sensors to ensure the legality of relay takeovers. The pool must have a minimum depth of two

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">RULES AND REGULATIONS</h3>
                <h4 class="pt-3">Competitive Swimming</h4>
                <p>Four strokes, or styles of swimming, are contested at swimming meets: freestyle, backstroke,
                    breaststroke, and butterfly. Swimmers race a variety of distances, ranging from 25 yards or meters
                    to 1600 yards. Each stroke has specific rules as to how swimmers may propel themselves through the
                    water.</p>
                <h4 class="pt-3">Free Style</h4>
                <p>Freestyle, often called the “crawl,” is the most flexible in its rules, and it is typically the
                    fastest stroke. The only rules are that the swimmer may not push off the bottom of the pool or pull
                    on the lane line, and must touch the far wall with some part of their body. Otherwise, swimmers may
                    use any type of stroke. Freestyle is swum face-down with alternating arm strokes; side-breathing;
                    and rapid, alternating up-and-down kicks. Freestyle races begin with swimmers doing forward-facing
                    dives from either a starting block or the side of the pool. In multi-lap races, swimmers can do
                    either an open turn or a flip turn. When doing a flip turn, the swimmer does not touch the wall with
                    his/her hand. Instead, the swimmer’s feet touch the wall. At the finish, freestyle swimmers touch
                    with one hand.</p>
                <h4 class="pt-3">Backstroke</h4>
                <p>Backstroke is often thought of as “upside-down freestyle.” As in freestyle, backstroke is swum with
                    alternating arm strokes and rapid, alternating, up-and-down kicks. Unlike freestyle, the swimmer
                    must be on his/her back, facing the sky. When swimmers turn their shoulders more than 90 degrees,
                    they are disqualified from the race for not remaining on their backs. The only exception to this
                    rule applies to the flip turn in multi-lap backstroke races: Swimmers may turn onto their stomachs
                    for one arm pull, provided their arm movement is continuous. When their feet leave the wall,
                    swimmers must be on their backs. Backstroke races start with swimmers already in the water. Swimmers
                    place their feet against the wall, and hold onto either the gutter or the grip built into the
                    starting block. At the finish of the race, backstroke swimmers must stay on their backs until they
                    touch the wall, ideally with one hand.</p>
                <h4 class="pt-3">Breastroke</h4>
                <p>Breastroke is often thought of as the “frog stroke,” as the kick is reminiscent of a frog’s kick. A
                    breaststroke swimmers arms and legs must move simultaneously, on the same horizontal plane, and
                    identically to each other. The arms and legs stay mostly underwater, but a swimmer’s head must break
                    the surface every stroke. So-called scissor kicks are not allowed. The arm stroke begins and ends in
                    streamline position. The hands scoop water out to the sides, before sweeping in toward the middle of
                    the body and then shooting forward. Swimmers are not allowed to pull their hands down past their
                    hips, and must keep their elbows in the water when their hands are shooting forward. On the
                    breastroke kick, swimmers must point their toes out to the side as the feet sweep out, around, and
                    back together. For every arm stroke there must be one, and only one, kick.</p>
                <p>Breaststroke races begin with a forward-facing dive from either the edge of the pool or the starting
                    block. At the beginning of each lap, swimmers may do one pull-down: one huge pull, in which the
                    hands sweep down to the thighs, and one giant kick to the surface. On the first stroke after the
                    pull-down, a swimmer’s head must break the surface of the water. Today’s swimmers are also allowed
                    to do one dolphin/butterfly kick in the first part of the pull-down, before the first breastroke
                    kick. At the end of each lap of a breaststroke race, swimmers must touch with two hands,
                    simultaneously and on the same horizontal plane. In multi-lap races, swimmers will use open turns,
                    not flip turns.</p>
                <h4 class="pt-3">Butterfly</h4>
                <p>Butterfly emerged as a new stroke in the 1950s, as swimmers were trying to find ways to swim
                    breastroke faster. The two primary innovations were the double over-the-water arm recovery, and the
                    dolphin kick. Butterfly is swum with an undulating, dolphin-like movement at the surface of the
                    water. The arms pull underwater simultaneously, and recover over the water, also simultaneously.
                    Both hands must come out of the water at the same time on every stroke. During each arm pull,
                    swimmers do two dolphin kicks, one when the hands enter the water, and one when the hands exit the
                    water. A swimmer’s feet must kick up and down together, ideally with the feet kept close together.
                    While the vast majority of swimmers lift the head and shoulders to breathe, some swimmers breathe to
                    the side, as in freestyle.</p>
                <p>Butterfly races begin with a forward-facing dive, and swimmers must finish each lap by touching the
                    wall with two hands simultaneously, on the same horizontal plane. At the beginning of each lap,
                    swimmers will do underwater dolphin kicks, but must break the surface of the water with their head
                    at or before 15 meters. In multi-lap races, swimmers will do open turns, as opposed to flip turns.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pt-3">Individual Medley Events</h4>
                <p>The individual medley, or IM (pronounced “eye-em”), is a race in which the swimmers swim each stroke
                    for one-fourth the total distance of the race. During each portion of the event, swimmers must swim
                    the strokes legally. For example, swimmers must finish the butterfly and breaststroke laps with
                    two-hand-touches and finish the backstroke lap on their backs. They must also swim the strokes in
                    this order: butterfly, backstroke, breastroke, freestyle. IM events begin with a forward-facing
                    dive.</p>
                <h4 class="pt-3">Relays</h4>
                <p>In a relay, four swimmers compete as a team. A swimmer may swim only once in a relay, and must swim
                    one-fourth the total distance of the race. In a freestyle relay, all swimmers swim freestyle. In a
                    medley relay, each swimmer swims a different stroke. In a medley relay the strokes must be swum in
                    this order: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle.</p>
                <p>Freestyle relays begin with a forward-facing dive, while medley relays begin with a backstroke start.
                    All the other swimmers in a relay can begin with a “rolling” start, provided they do not leave the
                    blocks before their teammate touches the wall. (In a rolling start, swimmers stand at the back of
                    the starting block, and generate momentum by swinging their arms, and taking a step to the front of
                    the block.)</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY</h3>
                <p>Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found, with the earliest evidence
                    dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC,
                    with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible,
                    Beowulf, the Quran and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages,
                    wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et
                    festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and
                    Pleasant to Read)</p>
                <p>Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first
                    indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public.[6] By 1837, the National Swimming
                    Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around
                    London. The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing
                    body, the Amateur Swimming Association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in
                    operation across the country.</p>
                <p>In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front
                    crawl to a European audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South
                    American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873, winning a local competition in
                    England. His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today.</p>
                <p>Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in
                    1875. Using the breaststroke technique, he swam the channel 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and
                    45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until T.W. Burgess made
                    the crossing in 1911.</p>
                <p>Other European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and
                    Hungary in 1896. The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The
                    world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892.</p>
                <p>Men's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. In 1902, the
                    Australian Richmond Cavill introduced freestyle to the Western world. In 1908, the world swimming
                    association, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed. Women's swimming was
                    introduced into the Olympics in 1912; the first international swim meet for women outside the
                    Olympics was the 1922 Women's Olympiad. Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a
                    variant of breaststroke, until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952.</p>

                    Olympic years. From 2001 until 2019, the Championships have been held every two years, in the odd
                    years.</p>
                <p>Due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the scheduling of both the Olympic Games and the
                    Championships between 2019 and 2025 became somewhat erratic, with World Championships not taking
                    place in Japan in 2021 to accommodate the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, and then delayed again to
                    2023 because of pandemic-related issues in Japan. As a result, an extraordinary edition of the event
                    was announced for 2022 in Budapest, Hungary, so as not to leave a four year gap between World
                    Championships. As a result, World Championships will be held in four consecutive years for the first
                    time – 2022 in Budapest,Hungary, 2023 in Fukuoka, Japan (the original 2021 event hosts, delayed
                    thrice), 2024 in Qatar (moved to 2024 from the original 2023 event, then moved again to January to
                    accommodate the 2024 Summer Olympics), and 2025 in a place to be announced. This will also mean
                    there will be six global championships in the space of four years (mid 2021 - to mid 2025). The
                    circle resumes with Budapest hosting the event again in 2027.</p>
                <p>Athletes from all 209 FINA members could take part in the competition. In 2019, records were set for
                    the most countries participating, with 192 members, and the most athletes participating, with 2,623
                    athletes.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">RECORDS</h3>
                <p>Here is a look at the four current world records that are unlikely to be toppled at any point in the
                    near future. Not surprising, each of the world records on this list was produced during the 2008-09
                    timeframe, when super suits took over the sport.</p>
                <h4 class="py-2">Michael Phelps (United States) – 400 Individual Medley (4:03.86)</h4>
                <p>It’s appropriate that Michael Phelps occupies a place on this list, and it’s fitting that the event
                    is the long medley, which pays tribute to the GOAT’s greatness as an all-around star. Unlike the
                    following world records on this list, which were set in full polyurethane, Phelps established this
                    record at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing in a Speedo LZR Racer. That suit, while certainly
                    providing a boost, does not measure up to the material introduced a year later.</p>
                <p>Phelps’ world-record time is more than a second faster than the No. 2 performance in history, the
                    4:05.18 mark that Ryan Lochte produced to capture gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. Phelps was
                    spectacular throughout his swim inside the Water Cube, going out in 54.92 for the butterfly leg and
                    covering the backstroke portion in 1:01.57. He followed with a breaststroke split of 1:10.56 and
                    closed with a freestyle effort of 56.79.</p>
                <h4 class="py-2">Paul Biedermann (Germany) – 200 Freestyle (1:42.00)</h4>
                <div class="para-container">
                    <img src="../IMAGES/record2.jpeg" alt="" class="score-img px-2">
                    <p class="px-2 pt-2">No one in a textile suit has ever cracked the 1:43 barrier, with Frenchman
                        Yannick Agnel holding the top mark in a legitimate suit with his 1:43.14 from the 2012 Olympics.
                        Beyond Agnel, only Michael Phelps has been under 1:44 in textile, that showing from his epic
                        week at the 2007 World Championships in Melbourne.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">And there Paul Biedermann sits as the world-record holder in a stupefying 1:42-flat.
                        That swim arrived at the circus that was the 2009 World Championships, and came at the expense
                        of Phelps, who watched Biedermann motorboat away from him. Biedermann was an excellent 200
                        freestyler, but the suit made him superhuman in the event, so much so that it will likely take
                        years before his time is challenged.</p>
                </div>
                <h4 class="py-2">Zhang Lin (China) – 800 Freestyle (7:32.12)</h4>
                <p>Want to see what might be the most-insane split of a race in history? Consider that on his way to the
                    world record at the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Zhang Lin covered the front half of his 800
                    freestyle in 3:46.79, with the last 400 meters spanned in 3:45.33. Those last eight laps would have
                    qualified for the final of the 400 freestyle at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>The textile best in the event is more than six seconds slower, and that mark of 7:38.57 by Sun Yang
                    must – in itself – be deemed suspect, due to its owner’s history of doping irregularities. In
                    textile, the next-best effort is the 7:38.65 of Aussie distance legend Grant Hackett, who generated
                    that performance on the way to his 400-800-1500 triple at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal.
                </p>
                <h4 class="py-2">Liu Zige – 200 Butterfly (2:01.81)</h4>
                <p>This thing isn’t going anywhere for a long time. When Chinese standout Liu Zige posted this
                    performance at her country’s National Games, it was appropriate for those in and around the sport to
                    chuckle. Yes, that’s how ridiculous this record is, and how unimaginable it would have been if not
                    for the introduction of suit material that made athletes seemingly hydroplane on top of the water.
                </p>
                <p>Liu’s record is more than two seconds faster than the textile standard in the event, which sits at
                    2:03.86 to China’s Zhang Yufei. By the way, that 2:03-high was delivered en route to the Olympic
                    title in 2020 in Tokyo. Adding to the absurdity of the record is that Liu touched in 58.08 at the
                    100-meter mark.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> About athletics</span> Athletics, a sport that was founded in
                    antiquity, has continued to adapt through the centuries, offering a dynamic, life-enhancing
                    sport the sport of competing in track and field events, including running races and various
                    competitions in jumping and throwing..

                    On 17 July 1912 in Stockholm, Sweden, following the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games in the
                    Swedish capital, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was founded as the world
                    governing body for the sport of track and field athletics.

                    During the 10 decades that followed, athletics underwent many changes which reflected the
                    political and socio-economic evolution of the wider world. Even the IAAF’s name has changed, in
                    2001 becoming the ‘International Association of Athletics Federations’ to reflect the growth of
                    a professional sporting world which did not exist in 1912, and then again in 2019 to 'World
                    Athletics'.</p>
                <p>World Athletics, the sport's governing body, defines athletics in six disciplines: track and
                    field, road running, race walking, cross country running, mountain running, and trail running.
                    Mountain running was added in 2003 and trail running was added in 2015.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Athletics-Categories</span><br>
                Athletics can be devided into five different categories.
            <ul>
                <li>Masters Athletics</li>
                <li>Senior Athletics</li>
                <li>Under 23</li>
                <li>Junior</li>
                <li>Youth</li>
            </ul>
            In the Masters of Athletics group, age groups spanning five years for athletes aged 35 and above are put. In
            senior athletics, there is no upper age limit but younger people competing in endurance events have some
            limitations. Under 23, as it suggests, athletes under the age of 23 are put. Age groups under 20 are kept in
            the junior group and under 18 are in the youth group.

                        athletes who represented rival schools and colleges, military organizations, and sports clubs
                        participated in it. Athletes participated in one or more events according to their choice and
                        favored sport.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">n these events, men and women compete separately. These are played in indoor and
                        outdoor formats. All the indoor competitions are held in winter while the outdoor events are
                        held in summer. Therefore, the name, track and field competitions was defined by the venue of
                        sport.</p>
                    <p class="px-2">A variety of running events are held on the track and are categorized according to

                    Some combined events like decathlons are organized for men and heptathlons for women, where the
                    athletes compete in various track and field events.

                    The prestigious track and field competitions are held within athletic championships at
                    multi-sport events like the Olympic Athletics Competition and World Championships. The
                    Paralympic Athletics Competition and the IPC World Championships are also organized.

                    These track and field events have become the most prominent part of the major athletic
                    championships. Many famous athletes come from the world of sports to this discipline..</p>

                            In throwing events, the athletes have to throw an instrument like javelin, discus etc. and
                            the distance to which the instrument is thrown will be measured. Events like shot put,
                            discus throw, javelin throw, and hammer throw are throwing events</p>

                        <p class="px-2">These can be of any distance, but mostly are classified into marathon, half
                            marathon, 10 km, and 5 km races. The marathon races are only one of these events which are
                            held at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and also in the Summer Olympics.

                            Half marathon races are held in the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships annually. The
                            marathon races are the only running event held in the IPC Athletics World Championships and
                            in the Summer Paralympics.

                            The five most prestigious marathon races at the elite level are conducted in the World
                            Marathon Majors series which include the Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, and the New York
                            City marathons.

                            This road running sport originated among the male servants who ran alongside the carriages
                            of the aristocrats in the 18th century, and also the people who ran errands for long
                            distances for their masters.

                        <p class="px-2">The first modern marathon was held in the 1896 Summer Olympics and this event
                            led to the growth of road running competitions into yearly events like the Boston Marathon,
                            the Lake Biwa Marathon, and Fukuoka Marathons</p>

                            in this race. Mountain Running has some common characteristics with cross country and
                            orienteering. In comparison to cross country running, the race courses of mountain racing is
                            long and steep. In comparison to orienteering, the courses are longer but steepness is less.

                            The participants shall have the capability to navigate the mountains as choosing the route
                            and
                            determining poor weather condition can increase time to reach the destination. In most

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">HISTORY</h3>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> In the 17th century, a sport festival called the Cotswold
                    Olympic Games came up in England which featured athletics in the form of sledgehammer throwing
                    competitions.

                    Similar competitions like the L’Olympiade de la Republique were held in the revolutionary France. It
                    is an early variant of the modern Summer Olympic Games. The major event of that competition was a
                    running event with various ancient Greek disciplines.

                    In 1880, the Amateur Athletic Association or AAA was established in England as the first national
                    body for athletics and it began organizing its own athletics competition every year called the AAA
                    Championships.

                </p>
                <p>The New York Athletic Club of the United States also started organizing national competitions called
                    the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1876. These sports became codified and standardized
                    by the English AAA and some other general sports organizations in the late 19th century like the
                    Amateur Athletic Union.

                    In the Olympic Games in 1896, an athletic competition was included as one of the competitions at the
                    quadrennial multi-sport event. At first, it was organized for men only. In 1928 Olympics, women’s
                    events were introduced in the athletics program.

                    The International Amateur Athletics Federation or IAAF is an international governing body founded in
                    1912 which changed its name as the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001. The
                    IAAF established a separate outdoor World Championship in 1983.

                    The first competitions organized internationally for athletes with physical disabilities (except for
                    deaf), began in 1952 when the first international Stoke Mandeville Games were organized for the
                    World War II veterans. These exclusively included athletes on wheelchairs which introduced the first
                    Paralympic Games which were held in 1960.

                    Federation (IAAF) which was founded in 1912. The organization was initially known as the
                    International Amateur Athletics Federation but changed in the late 1970s as to remove the word
                    amateur from the name and focus on professionalism.

                    The IAAF currently has 213 member nations and territories which are divided into six continents –
                    Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, North America, and South America.

                    All the sports which come under athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at
                    international or continental level, rather all fall under the athletics authorities −

                    <p class="px-2 pt-2">The primary global athletics championships are held by the IAAF called the IAAF
                        World Championships in Athletics. This features an event program quite identical to the
                        Olympics. Athletics like road running, race-walking, and track and field are featured in the
                        competition.

                        Although cross country running is not held at the World Championships, it has its own discrete
                        global championships called the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. These cross country
                        championships have been held annually since 1973.</p>

                    <p class="px-2">Exclusively for track and field events, there are championships by the IAAF called

                        Championships annually as the foremost separate road running event.

                        For race-walking, there is no world championship status but the IAAF World Race Walking Cups
                        fills in the job for race-walking. The outdoor track and field is the only sport which is not
                        competed globally as a championship but has its own genre made by the IAAF called as the IAAF
                        Continental Cup.

                        The IAAF Continental Cup is made for the sole purpose of outdoor track and field events. There
                        are other world championships like the IAAF World Junior and World Youth Championships in
                        Athletics, for the athletes who are under the age of 19 and 17, respectively.</p>

                        beginning in 1896. However, the cross country races have been dropped out the program.

                        The competitions of the Olympic are the most prestigious athletics contest as they are the most
                        watched events of the Summer Olympics. There are a total of 47 athletics events held at the

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey</span> <br>
                    Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated
                    on
                    either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. <br>There are many types
                    of
                    hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. In order
                    to
                    help make the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by
                    another
                    word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey". <br>In
                    each
                    of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either
                    a
                    type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two notable
                    exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a "puck") with a hole in the
                    center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during
                    the
                    Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified
                    in
                    roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team
                    sport
                    in the newly emerging Special Olympics. The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor
                    hockey,
                    is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the
                    Canadian
                    ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963. Ringette was also invented
                    by
                    Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936.
                    <br>In
                    most of the world, the term hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in Canada, the United
                    States,
                    Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey. <br>In more
                    recent history, the word "hockey" is used in reference to either the summer sport of field hockey,
                    which
                    is a stick and ball game, and the winter ice team skating sports of bandy and ice hockey. This is
                    due to
                    the fact that field hockey and other stick and ball sports and their related variants preceded games
                    which would eventually be played on ice with ice skates, namely bandy and ice hockey, as well as
                    sports
                    involving dry floors such as roller hockey and floor hockey. However, the "hockey" referred to in
                    common
                    parlance often depends on locale, geography, and the size and popularity of the sport involved. For
                    example, in Europe, "hockey" more typically refers to field hockey, whereas in Canada, it typically
                    refers to ice hockey. In the case of bandy, the game was initially called "hockey on the ice" and
                    preceded the organization and development of ice hockey, but was officially changed to "bandy" in
                    the
                    early 20th century in order to avoid confusion with ice hockey, a separate sport.

                <h3 style="color: #0DA1FF;">POSITIONS</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Forwards-</span>The main objective for a forward in Ice
                    Hockey,
                    simply put, is to score on the opposing team’s goaltender. Generally speaking, forwards are shorter
                    than
                    defensemen and are usually quicker and shiftier on their skates, in order to get past the defensemen
                    on
                    the opposing team. Each team will have three forwards on the ice for a majority of the game, each
                    one
                    with specific roles and positioning on the ice. Below, we’ll look at just that; each position, their
                    role, and their individual skills.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center-</span>The Center in Ice Hockey is generally the main player
                    responsible for dictating the gameplay while the puck is in the offensive zone. They could also
                    often be
                    the ones responsible for skating the puck into the offensive zone as well.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center Skills-</span>While every player has a certain skill set,
                    Centers
                    are looked at as the “quarterbacks” of Ice Hockey. This means that their overall hockey sense and
                    vision
                    is always some of the best on the team, allowing them to find open space and teammates, and read
                    plays
                    before they happen. In addition, Centers typically have some of the best stick handling skills in
                    tight
                    areas, as well as great passing skills, making them valuable playmakers in the offensive zone.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center Responsibilities-</span>Centers have a variety of different
                    responsibilities while on the ice, on both offense and defense. One of the primary responsibilities
                    as a
                    Center is to win faceoffs. This is crucial in order for their team to gain possession of the puck.
                    Another key responsibility is to provide support for their wingers, meaning setting up the plays in
                    the
                    offensive zone, make great passes, and lead the forecheck and backcheck.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center Positioning-</span>While the puck is in the offensive zone,
                    Centers will be found dictating the play from the middle of the zone. This zone includes in front of
                    the
                    opposing goalie, to the edge of each faceoff dot, and out to the blue line. From here, they can
                    receive
                    passes from teammates, dish passes to open wingers or defensemen, or simply screen the opposing
                    goaltender for a potential goal. In the defensive zone, Centers have the most surface area to cover,
                    spanning from the front of their net, up to the blue line, and out to each faceoff dot. Their job
                    here
                    is to lock down the slot area of their defensive zone. They should also be aware of where their
                    other
                    teammates are on the ice, to ensure that there are no open areas for the opposing team</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Wing-</span>The Left Wing in Ice Hockey lines up to the left
                    side
                    of the Center and plays most of the game on the left side of the ice, on both offense and defense.
                    These
                    players range in sizes, but are usually bigger than Centers, but smaller than Defensemen.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Wing Skills-</span>These offensive-minded players are looked at
                    as
                    the primary goal scorers, meaning the Left Wing will have a great wrist shot and slap shot. The Left
                    Wing will also be required to be strong on the puck, in order to not get it stolen from opposing
                    defensemen. Going hand-in-hand, Left Wingers will want to be strong against the boards while battle
                    opposing players for the puck. Lastly, they must possess great ice vision to find open teammates on
                    the
                    ice</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Wing Responsibilities-</span>Primary responsibilities of a Left
                    Winger include getting good shots onto the opposing team’s net, make good passes to your Center in
                    the
                    slot, and battle for pucks in the corners and along the boards. Left Wingers can also often be the
                    ones
                    responsible for carrying the puck into the offensive zone and setting up the play for their team.
                    Defensively, Left Wingers are responsible for locking down the opposing team’s right defenseman or
                    intercepting passes between the two. If the puck is stolen by someone from their team, it is their
                    responsibility to get open down the ice for a breakout pass</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Wing Positioning-</span>While in the offensive zone, Left
                    Wingers
                    will play on the left side of the ice, ranging from the center of the left faceoff circle, to the
                    left
                    corner, to directly in front of the opposing goaltender. On defense, Left Wingers will stay high and
                    defend the opposing team’s right defenseman. This zone will include up to the blue line and across
                    to
                    its halfway point, down to the halfway point of the left circle</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Wing-</span>The Right Winger plays opposite of the Left Winger
                    and
                    to the right side of the Centerman. Like the Left Winger, the Right Winger will be responsible for
                    locking down the right side of the ice, on both offense and defense</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Wing Skills-</span>The Right Winger are looked at as the
                    primary
                    goal scorers on an Ice Hockey team. They will spend a majority, if not all, of the game roaming
                    around
                    on the right side of the ice, trying to get shots off on net. These players tend to have one of the
                    best
                    shots on the team, allowing them to snipe corners with ease! Right Wingers are also strong on their
                    feet
                    and strong with the puck on their stick. This allows them to win battles for the puck along the
                    boards
                    and to get away from opposing defensemen.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Wing Responsibilities-</span>Like the Left Winger, Right
                    Wingers
                    are responsible for getting good shots onto the opposing team’s net, will frequently be the ones
                    skating
                    the puck into the offensive zone and setting up the play, be tasked to battle for the puck with
                    opposing
                    players when it goes to the boards or corners, and set up teammates with good passes for a potential
                    scoring play. On defense, Right Wingers will be responsible for backchecking hard if the other team
                    gains possession of the puck and cover open passing lanes in order to force a turnover.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Wing Positioning-</span>On offense, Right Wingers will play on
                    the
                    right side of the zone. This includes the right corner, up to the right faceoff dot, and right in
                    front
                    of the opposing goalie.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Defensemen-</span>During regular play, there will be two
                    defensemen on the ice per team. The primary objective for defensemen in Ice Hockey is to stop the
                    opposing team from scoring.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Defenseman-</span>Working in unison with his defensive partner,
                    the
                    Left Defenseman will possess a variety of skills and responsibilities, on both offense and defense.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Defenseman Skills-</span>Highly Skilled Left Defensemen are
                    great
                    skaters, especially backwards. They will also have great hockey IQ in order to read plays from the
                    opposing team and determine where the puck and net is at all times, they have great shots, and are
                    great
                    passers, especially when making breakout passes from the defensive zone.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Defenseman Responsibilities-</span>Left Defensemen are
                    responsible
                    for ensuring that the opposing team does not score. This includes blocking shots, finding open lanes
                    and
                    covering them, and battling with opposing wingers in the corners to get the puck. Additionally, Left
                    Defensemen are responsible for controlling the play while in the defensive zone, meaning playing
                    positionally sound so the opposing team does not get a good shot off on net</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left Defenseman Positioning-</span>While in their defensive zone,
                    Left
                    Defensemen are required to lock down the left corner of the ice. This includes the left corner, up
                    to
                    the center of the left faceoff dot, to in front of their net. In the offensive zone, Left Defensemen
                    will stay on the top left side of the zone, which includes at the blue line, to center ice, to the
                    top
                    of the left faceoff dot</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Defenseman-</span>Working in unison with his defensive
                    partner,
                    the Right Defenseman will possess a variety of skills and responsibilities, on both offense and
                    defense.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Defenseman Skills-</span>Right Defensemen will be some of the
                    most
                    skilled skaters on the team, especially backwards. They will also possess great hockey IQ helping
                    them
                    read plays and cover the open spots on the ice. They also have great shots, especially slap shots,
                    and
                    will be great passers, especially when making breakout passes from their defensive zone</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Defenseman Responsibilities-</span>The primary responsibility
                    for
                    a Right Defenseman is to prevent the other team from scoring. This includes blocking shots, finding
                    and
                    covering open areas in the zone, and keeping heads on a swivel to make sure that they are always
                    between
                    the puck and their net. Additionally, Right Defensemen are responsible for controlling the play
                    while in
                    the defensive zone, meaning playing positionally sound to ensure that the opposing team does not get
                    a
                    good shot off on their net</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Defenseman Positioning-</span>While in their defensive zone,
                    Right
                    Defensemen are required to lock down the right corner of the ice. This includes the right corner, up
                    to
                    the center of the right faceoff dot, to in front of their net. In the offensive zone, Right
                    Defensemen
                    will stay on the top right side of the zone, which includes at the blue line, to center ice, to the
                    top
                    of the right faceoff dot.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Goalie-</span>The Goalie is the main player on the ice who is
                    responsible for stopping pucks from entering the goal, when shot from the opposing team. Also, the
                    goaltender has the most creative liberties when it comes to gear colors and their overall look on
                    the
                    ice.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Goalie Skills-</span>In addition to making saves, ice hockey
                    goalies possess many skills which include skating, rebound control, ability to fill space, cut down
                    the
                    angle to the shooter, stopping dump-ins, making breakout passes and helping direct teammates see the
                    play behind them as a visionary on the ice.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Goalie Styles-</span>The goalie position has developed over
                    the
                    last century. Starting with playing a pure stand up style and evolving into a hybrid style and
                    ultimately ending in today’s butterfly style. Stand up goalies never went down to their knees and
                    often
                    made saves while standing up with their stick blade flat on the ice. Hybrid goaltenders started to
                    drop
                    down because of the realization that they can control rebounds better. However, they still had older
                    tendencies to try and keep the upper body straight and often utilized a butterfly save with only one
                    knee down at a time. The butterfly style has morphed and tweaked in the last three decades, however
                    it
                    is the most common style used by goaltenders as it provides the best probability of stopping the
                    puck.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Butterfly-</span> <br>There are two types of butterfly goalies:
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hybrid Butterfly:</span>Goalies who mix modern and older
                        techniques
                        to do what is necessary to stop the puck.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Athletic Butterfly:</span> Goalies that rely on responsive,
                        fast
                        and often explosive movements to stop the puck.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blocking Style-</span>The most common style is the blocking
                    butterfly
                    which goalies drop down to reduce the open area for the puck to make it past them. Often these
                    goalies
                    drop, squeeze the body together and try to redirect pucks to the corner when making saves.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Player Roles-</span>While the game of ice hockey consists of
                    six
                    different positions, each position has a “sub-category”, meaning the style of player playing that
                    position will have a different role based on their skillset, physical stature, the line they play
                    on,
                    and so on</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sniper-</span>Snipers are generally the stars of their team and be
                    looked upon to score a goal in a time of need. Having the best shot on their respective teams, they
                    are
                    expected to produce high goal scoring numbers year in and year out. Big name snipers currently in
                    the
                    NHL include Alex Ovechkin, Patrik Laine, and Nikita Kucherov.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playmaker-</span>While playmakers don’t always have the best shot,
                    they
                    make up for it with their great hockey IQ and creative passing abilities, as well as their superior
                    ability to find open space on the ice. With pass-first mindsets, playmakers accumulate most of their
                    points setting up their teammates for goals. Big name Playmakers currently in the NHL include Sidney
                    Crosby, Connor McDavid, and Nathan MacKinnon.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Forward-</span>Featuring a unique blend of strength, skill,
                    and
                    finesse, Power Forwards are essential for any hockey team. Usually bigger in stature compared to
                    Playmakers or Snipers, Power Forwards are more so inclined to battle with opposing players during
                    puck
                    battles along the boards. If they get the puck in open ice, they also have enough skill to snipe a
                    top
                    corner with ease. Big name Power Forwards currently in the NHL include Jamie Benn, Blake Wheeler,

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the most important position in hockey?-</span>While some
                    teams
                    are offensively focused and others are defensively focused, there is not one single “most important”
                    position. Forwards are important because they are the ones mainly tasked with scoring goals to put
                    their
                    team ahead, defensemen are important because they prevent the other team from scoring goals, and
                    goalies
                    are important because they are the ones stopping the opposing team from scoring goals.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the most difficult position to play in hockey?-</span>It is
                    said
                    that goalie is the most difficult position to play within Ice Hockey, and one of the hardest to play
                    in
                    any sport. The main objective for a goalie is to keep the puck out of the net, and with a great one,
                    they can control the game and greatly influence their team’s confidence.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Which hockey position scores the most goals?-</span>This almost
                    always
                    depends on the team, but generally speaking, the Left Winger and Right Winger are looked as the
                    primary
                    goal scorers of most teams. Guys like Alex Ovechkin and Patrick Kane are two prolific veteran
                    Wingers
                    that have been firing pucks into the back of nets for more than a decade.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Which hockey position gets the most assists?-</span>Centers are seen
                    at
                    the primary playmakers of almost every team; therefore, they will get the most assists, which
                    usually
                    means the most points. They are the players who “quarterback” plays while in the offensive zone and
                    hit
                    open players with great passes. Guys like Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby are two highly
                    intelligent
                    and crafty players who use their hockey IQ’s to rack up points.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Which position should I play in hockey?-</span>While there are many
                    different factors when determining what position, you should play, this article will serve as a
                    starting
                    point when learning about each position. If you are a bigger player and strong on your skates,
                    defense
                    might be a good start. If you are a smaller, but quicker skater, and have good stickhandling skills,
                    Winger might be a viable option.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pitch Measurements-</span>A hockey pitch is the playing surface for the
                game
                of field hockey. Historically, the game was played on natural turf (grass) and nowadays it is
                predominantly
                played on an artificial turf. The transition onto artificial pitches came during the 1970s and was made
                mandatory for major competitions in 1976. All the lines, markings and goal specifications are outlined
                by
                the International Hockey Federation in "The Rules of Hockey" <br>All line markings on the pitch form
                part of
                the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line is still in the field of play; a ball
                on
                the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard)
                line
                has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a
                ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored. <br>Due to the original formulation of the
                rules in England, the standard dimensions of a hockey pitch were originally expressed in imperial units.
                The
                rules are now expressed explicitly in metric dimensions (since 1998), although the use of the imperial
                terms
                remains common in some countries.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Stick Length-</span> <br>The length of your field hockey stick is
                very important. We have listed a few methods for choosing a hockey stick length below.
            <ul>
                <li>Junior Hockey Sticks are available in sizes 24” up to full size 36.5”. Junior sticks are available
                    in
                    wood or fibre Glass. Prices start at approx €20</li>
                <li>To measure a child (5 Ft 2” or under) hold the hockey stick at their side and it should be at their
                    hip
                    or belly button.</li>
                <li>If you cannot decide between two lengths, you should consider your child’s position. On defence, a
                    longer stick is useful to provide a longer reach and to allow the player to drive the ball further.
                    On
                    the other hand, a shorter stick improves a player’s stick handling skills on offense.</li>
                <li>Once a young person reaches the age of approximately 13 they will be in a full size stick ie 36.5”(5
                    f
                    3”), so you do not need to measure the stick to your hip or belly button once you reach this height.
                </li>
                <li>Senior Sticks are available in wood, Glass Fibre and a combination of Fibre Glass, Kevlar and
                    Carbon.
                    When Senior Players are choosing a hockey stick they will choose a stick based on what feels
                    comfortable
                    for them and their style, so it is more of a personal choice.</li>
                <li>The majority of hockey players use a 36.5” stick. The best way to choose a hockey stick is to come
                    into
                    the shop and speak to our expert staff, try out a few sticks and choose the one that feels the best
                    for
                    you.</li>
                <li>There are no left handed hockey sticks, all field hockey sticks are made to be played right handed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span>If you are 5’10” you don’t have to use a 37.5″ stick, it is
                completely a matter of personal choice and equally someone under 5’10” may prefer a slightly longer
                Hockey
                stick and opt for the 37.5″, in our experience the majority of Hockey players chooose a 36.5″ Hockey
                Stick.
                The best advice we can offer is to come in and try out a few Hockey sticks so that you choose the stick
                that
                is most suitable for your position and style of play.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How big is a Hockey Ball-</span>A regulation field hockey ball has a
                diameter between 7.13 and 7.48cm, which equates to 2.81-2.94 inches. This means that a regulation field
                hockey ball has a circumference that is between 22.4 and 23.5 cm (8.82-9.25 inches).
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">How much does a field hockey ball weigh-</span>In accordance with
                    FIH
                    (International Hockey Federation) regulations, a field hockey ball should weigh 156-163 g (5.5-5.75
                    oz).
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What colour should a hockey ball be-</span>According to the FIH
                    field
                    hockey balls should have a single block colour. White hockey balls are most commonly used although
                    yellow balls can also be used to provide a better contrast with the playing surface/weather
                    conditions.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why do hockey balls have dimples-</span>The dimpled hockey ball was
                    invented in the early 1980s and is now the preferred type of ball for high-level matches. <br><br>

                    Adding dimples to a ball changes its aerodynamic properties, allowing hockey balls to travel further
                    and
                    faster. This is down to the fact that dimples make the surface irregular, which in turn reduces the
                    amount of drag on the ball as it travels through the air or along the playing surface. <br><br>

                    The dimples in a hockey ball allow small air pockets to form on the ball's surface. The pockets of
                    air
                    move with the ball, rather than against it, allowing it to travel more efficiently.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is a hockey ball made of-</span>Early hockey balls back in the
                    1800’s were made with a wooden core and a leather exterior but as you’d expect things have changed
                    since
                    then! <br><br>

                    The majority of hockey balls nowadays are made from solid plastic, although higher quality field
                    hockey
                    match balls are usually manufactured with a PVC exterior and a cork, wood and/or rubber core.
                    <br><br>

                    FORZA Match Dimple Hockey Balls feature a cork dual composition core, with a heavy-duty PVC
                    exterior.
                    The specialised core improves the ball's connection with the hockey stick and improves the ball’s
                    performance on a range of playing surfaces.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to play-</span> <br>Hockey is played outdoors in rectangular field.
                Two
                teams of 11 players each play the game. One of them wears helmet, pads, and stands in-front of goal with
                a
                J-shaped hockey stick. The sport requires lot of stamina stand athleticism as one has to run along with
                ball
                and stick to score the goal. </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting Ready-</span>The game begins with a toss where both captains are
                present. One of them calls it correctly and gets the choice to pass first or choose a particular end of
                the
                field; just like the toss in other games. <br>The game is played for 75 minutes that includes a five
                minute
                half-time interval. Both sessions are played for 35 minutes each. The time is paused in between the game
                for
                substitutions, treatment for injury, etc., and then resumes.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Glimpse of the Game-</span>The hockey players take their
                respective
                positions on the field. One of the teams starts the game with a centre pass and continues to attack
                opponent
                to score a goal. The player taking centre pass can only stand in the other half of field while his team
                members should stand within their half of defending goal. The player taking centre pass is permitted to
                hit
                the ball in any direction.
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>The team members keep passing the ball and look for opportunities to score the goal while the
                        opponents tackle them and try to take control of the ball.</li>
                    <li>If the game is paused any moment for injury or substitution, it resumes by the player passing
                        the
                        ball from nearest spot of stoppage of play. This is called bully.</li>
                    <li>A player from each team stands close to the ball with defending goals on their right to take a
                        bully. Both players tap faces of their sticks and one of the players is allowed to hit the ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>A free-hit situation arises when a player hits the ball outside the sideline or baseline.
                        Free-hit
                        is taken by a defender by placing the ball 15 meters in line to the centre of goal.</li>
                    <li>If a ball is hit outside the sideline by a player then defender of the opponent team will take
                        free
                        hit by placing the ball in line within 15 meters from where the ball has crossed.</li>
                    <li>If the ball is hit outside the back line by a player then defender of opponent team will take
                        free
                        hit by placing the ball within 15 meters from centre of goal.</li>
                    <li>If the ball is hit outside the back line by opponent player then a penalty corner is awarded to
                        the
                        team attacking the goal. The ball is placed in line to back line and to right of goal post at a
                        distance of 15 meters.</li>
                    <li>If the ball is hit outside the back line by goal keeper of opponent team then a corner is
                        awarded to
                        attacking team. The ball is then placed in line to 23 meters line and hit by player of attacking
                        team.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration of a Match-</span> <br> A regular hockey match takes place for
                70
                minutes consisting two halves each of 35 minutes. Also, sometimes matches end in draw. But the official
                matches should have a winner unlike other matches. If in any case, the game is a tie then extra time is
                given. If there is tie again then penalty flick competition decides the winner of the match. <br>A
                player
                passes the ball among them to progress it towards the goal using a triangle method of passing system.
                This
                prevents the opponent to intercept the ball.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Rules-</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Hockey players can only hit the ball with the flat side of their stick.</li>
                <li>Hockey players (other than the goalkeeper) are not allowed to use their feet, or any other parts of
                    the
                    body, to control the ball at any time.</li>
                <li>A goal can only be scored either from a field goal, a penalty corner, or from a penalty stroke. A
                    field
                    goal is a goal scored from open play, and can only be scored from inside the ‘striking circle’, in
                    front
                    of the opponent's goal. If the hockey ball is hit from outside the circle and goes into the goal, it
                    does not count as a goal.</li>
                <li>Hockey players may not trip, push, charge, interfere with, or physically handle an opponent in any
                    way.
                    Hockey is a non-contact sport and all fouls result in a free hit or a ‘penalty corner’ for the
                    non-offending team depending on where the infringement took place and the severity of the foul.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Fouls-</span> <br>A number of different types of foul may be
                punished
                in a game of hockey. Some of the basic ones to watch out for include.
            <ul>
                <li>Obstruction. This is awarded against a hockey player who uses their body or stick to prevent an
                    opponent
                    from reaching the ball.</li>
                <li>Third-party obstruction. This is awarded when a hockey player positions themselves between the ball
                    and
                    an opponent, allowing a team-mate an unobstructed play on the ball.</li>
                <li>Advancing. This is awarded against a player who shoves, pushes, or advances the ball in any way,
                    using
                    any part of their body.</li>
                <li>Backsticks. This is awarded against a player who strikes the ball with the rounded back of the
                    hockey
                    stick.</li>
                <li>Hockey stick interference. This is awarded against a player who uses their stick to hit an
                    opponent’s
                    stick, either intentionally or unintentionally.</li>
                <li>Undercutting. This is awarded against a player who lifts the ball in a dangerous manner.</li>
                <li>Sticks. This is awarded against a player who raises their stick dangerously near another player.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Punishment Hockey-</span> <br>Fouls in a hockey match can be punished in
                three main ways. These are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Free hit. This is a free play awarded on any offenses that occurs outside of the scoring circle. It
                    usually takes place at the location of the violation. All opposing players must stand at least 5
                    yards
                    (4.6m) from where the hit is to be taken.</li>
                <li>Penalty corner. This is awarded to the attacking team when the defense either commits a foul inside
                    the
                    striking circle or intentionally hits the ball out-of-bounds over the end line. A penalty corner is
                    taken by an attacking player at a spot on the end-line 10 yards (9.2m) away from the nearest goal
                    post.
                    All other attackers must stand outside the striking circle, while five defenders, including the
                    goalkeeper, stand behind the end line until contact is made with the ball. Once the ball has been
                    put in
                    play, all players can rush into the circle to either defend or shoot the ball at the goal.</li>
                <li>Penalty stroke. This is awarded to the attacking side when an offense is committed by the defending
                    side
                    which is deemed to have prevented an almost certain goal. A penalty is taken 7 yards (6.4m) from
                    goal,
                    with the player having only the goalkeeper to beat.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Umpires-</span> <br>There are two umpires on the hockey field,
                who
                are usually responsible for each half of the pitch. A player who breaches the rules, either by rough or
                dangerous play, misconduct, or an intentional offenses, can be shown a card — either green, yellow or
                red.
            <ul>
                <li>Green. This is an official warning given to the hockey player to not break the rules.</li>
                <li>Yellow. This results in a hockey player being sent off the pitch for 5 minutes, following an
                    offense.
                </li>
                <li>Red. A red card results in an early shower and is given for more serious offense.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penalties-</span>
            <ul>
                <li>There are 4 referees in NHL games. When a player violates one of the rules of the game, he is given
                    a
                    penalty by a referee.</li>
                <li>Penalties are given for body fouls such as hitting from behind, elbowing and fighting.</li>
                <li>Penalties are also given for stick fouls like slashing, spearing, hooking, holding, tripping,
                    cross-checking and high-sticking.</li>
                <li>Penalties can also be given for other infractions such as delay of game, too many men on the ice,
                    and
                    unsportsmanlike conduct.</li>
                <li>If the offending player’s team is in possession of the puck, the referee will blow his whistle
                    immediately to stop play and enforce the penalty.</li>
                <li>If the offending player’s team doesn’t possess the puck, the referee will raise his arm to show the
                    delayed calling of a penalty.</li>
                <li>Standard penalties are 2 minutes in length and players serve their penalties in the penalty box.
                </li>
                <li>While a penalty is being served, the opposing team receives a man advantage opportunity called a
                    Power
                    Play. A Power Play lasts for the duration of the penalty. In the case of minor penalties, the Power
                    Play
                    will end early if the team with the man advantage scores a goal.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hockey Umpires Rules and Regulations-</span> <br>An umpire in field
                hockey
                is a person with the authority to make decisions on a hockey pitch in accordance with the rules of the
                game.
                Each match is controlled by two such umpires. In theory they are responsible for decisions taken on
                their
                respective half of the field, but practically they 'control' on either diagonal half of the field. In
                many
                higher-level events, a reserve umpire is appointed in addition to the two field umpires to act as a
                back-up
                in the event of injury or other issue preventing a field umpire from commencing or continuing a match.
                In
                World-Level competitions, a video umpire is also appointed in addition to the field and reserve umpires.
                <br>The role of the umpires is to control the match, apply the rules of hockey, uphold a duty of care to
                the
                players (keeping the game safe), be the judges of fair play and keep the flow. Each umpire has the
                primary
                responsibility for decisions in one half of the field, and is the only one allowed to award a penalty
                corner, penalty stroke or goal in their half of the field or a free hit in their circle (see diagram).
                However, they may consult with their colleague before making these decisions. They must also ensure that
                the
                correct amount of time is allowed for the match and record the scoring of goals and issuing of penalty
                cards
                to players. Similarly to football referees, most decisions are signalled using a whistle (and the use of
                the
                whistle is specifically instructed in the Rules), and the use of various hand signals. <br>Originally
                their
                half of the field was taken to coincide with the two halves of the pitch as divided by the halfway line.
                Now
                the division is generally taken to run down the diagonal of the pitch, from top left to bottom right in
                the
                accompanying pitch diagram. For breaches of the rules bordering the umpires' 'area of control',
                jurisdiction
                is generally given to whichever umpire the play is coming towards. When play is in and around their
                shooting
                circle, the umpire will generally take up a position in the shooting circle, particularly if play has
                come
                from the further side of the pitch, and when play is more in the middle of the pitch will be closer to
                the
                right-hand sideline (facing the goal for which they are responsible). Positioning in the shooting circle
                is
                critical as correct decisions are necessary here to maintain the control of the match as well as the
                outcome. Exact positioning will be determined by the need to keep the ball in view, the desire to be
                reasonably close to the ball and the relative pace of the game. The preferred position of most umpires
                is
                behind and to the right of the play as the lead umpire, whilst the other umpire (the trailing umpire) is
                around 15m behind at a 45 degree angle with the engaged umpire.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting and Restarting Play-</span> <br>The procedure followed for the
                start and the restart of a match of hockey : A coin is tossed. The winning team has the choice to select
                the
                goal post for the first half or to start the match with centre pass. The centre pass is taken from the
                centre of the field and the ball can be played in any direction. The players of both the teams need to
                be in
                their respective halves except the player taking the centre pass. Restart of match : The match is
                restarted
                with centre pass. It is taken from the centre of the field and is taken by the opponent of the team
                committing the offence.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Early Years-</span><br>Where did hockey originate? Who set down
                    the
                    first rules of the modern game? What was the FIH set up to do?
                    Whether you’re a history buff or simply want to impress you mates with you knowledge of the game,
                    discover more about the history of hockey below. <br>The roots of hockey are buried deep in
                    antiquity.
                    Historical records show that a crude form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in
                    Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game was also played in Iran in around
                    2,000BC.
                    <br>
                    Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well
                    as by
                    the Aztecs several centuries before Columbus arrived in the New <World class="br"></World>
                    The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to
                    the
                    growth of public schools, such as Eton. <br>
                    The first Hockey Association was formed in the UK in 1876 and drew up the first formal set of rules.
                    The
                    original association survived for just six years but, in 1886, it was revived by nine founding
                    member
                    clubs. <br>The inaugural Olympic Hockey Competition for men was held in London in 1908 with England,
                    Ireland, Scotland and Wales competing separately. With the addition of Germany and France, the
                    competition ran with six teams. <br>
                    After having made its first appearance at the London Games, hockey was subsequently dropped from the
                    1912 Stockholm Games after host nations were granted control over ‘optional sports’. It reappeared
                    in
                    1920 in Antwerp after pressure from Belgian hockey advocates before being omitted again in Paris in
                    1924. <br>
                    The formation of the International Hockey Federation in 1924 was not soon enough for the Paris
                    Olympics
                    but it did grant hockey re-entry in Amsterdam in 1928. Hockey has been on the programme ever since,
                    with
                    women's hockey included for the first time in Moscow in 1980. <br>Motivated by hockey’s omission
                    from
                    the 1924 Paris Games, the Fédération Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH) was founded by Paul
                    Léautey. M. Léautey, who would later become the first president of the FIH, called together seven
                    National Federations to form the sport’s international governing body.
                    These founding members, which represented both men's and women's hockey in their countries, were
                    Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Spain and Switzerland. <br>
                    Popularised in the late 19th century, the women’s game developed quickly in many countries. In 1927,
                    the
                    International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations (IFWHA) was formed. After celebrating their
                    respective Golden Jubilees - the FIH in 1974 and the IFWHA in 1980 - the two organisations came
                    together
                    in 1982 to form the current FIH. <br>
                    By 1964, there were already 50 countries affiliated with the FIH, as well as three Continental
                    Associations - Africa, Pan America and Asia - and in 1974, there were 71 members. Today, the
                    International Hockey Federation consists of five Continental Associations, 137 National Associations
                    and
                    is still growing

                    <img class="worldcup-img" src="../IMAGES/trophy.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The Hockey World Cup was first conceived by Pakistan's Air Marshal Nur
                    Khan. He
                    proposed his idea to the FIH through Patrick Rowley, the first editor of World Hockey magazine.
                    Their
                    idea was approved on 26 October 1969 and adopted by the FIH Council at a meeting in Brussels on 12
                    April
                    1970. The FIH decided that the inaugural World Cup would be held in October 1971, in Pakistan. <br>

                    However, political issues would prevent that first competition from being played in Pakistan. The
                    FIH
                    had inadvertently scheduled the first World Cup to be played in Pakistan during the Bangladesh
                    Liberation War. Furthermore, Pakistan and India had been at war with each other only six years
                    earlier.
                    When Pakistan invited India to compete in the tournament, a crisis arose. Pakistanis, led by
                    cricketer
                    Abdul Hafeez Kardar, protested against India's participation in the Hockey World Cup. <br>

                    Given the intense political climate between Pakistan and India, the FIH decided to move the
                    tournament
                    elsewhere. In March 1971, coincidentally in the same month Bangladesh declared independence from
                    Pakistan, the FIH decided to move the first Hockey World Cup to the Real Club de Polo grounds in
                    Barcelona, Spain, which was considered a neutral and peaceful European site. <br>

                    The FIH has set no requirements or limitations on the size of the competition. The 1971 Cup included
                    only ten nations, the smallest World Cup. The 1978 Cup featured fourteen nations. The 2002, 2018
                    Cups
                    featured sixteen nations. The remaining 10 World Cups have featured 12 nations. <br>

                    The first three tournaments were held every two years. The 1978 Cup was the only tournament held
                    three
                    years from the previous one. It was halfway between the Summer Olympics hockey competition and has
                    continued that way. In other words, the tournament has been held every four years ever since.</p>

                <p class="py-3">The highest international goals scorer in classic field hockey is major Dhyan Chand of
                    British India, he scored 570 goals in 185 international matches. The player who was second highest
                    international goals scorer in hockey & highest goal scorer in modern hockey on artificial turf was
                    Paul
                    Litjens of Netherlands. He scored a total of 267 international goals in 177 matches. He remained
                    highest
                    international goals scorer on artificial turf for 22 years, from 1982 to 2004, until Sohail Abbas of
                    Pakistan broke the record against India at Amritsar in 2004.[1] Abbas became the sixth Pakistani to
                    achieve 100 international goals in his career when he scored a hat-trick against Great Britain at
                    the
                    2000 Summer Olympics. He scored a record 348 international goals. He also played the fewest matches
                    to
                    score 100 goals. <br>The first player to score 100 goals on artificial turf for India is Dhanraj
                    Pillay,
                    who scored a total of 170 international goals. Manzoor-ul-Hassan of Pakistan was the first player
                    from
                    Asia to score 100 international goals. The first player outside of Europe and Asia to score 100
                    international goals was Mark Hager of Australia. To date, eleven players representing Netherlands
                    have
                    scored 100 or more international goals, the most of any country. The European Hockey Federation has
                    the
                    highest number of players who have scored 100 goals in their international career, with 22 players
                    achieving the feat so far.</p>
